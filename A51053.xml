            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEFORE we come to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Recital of the Six Voyages which I have made during 14 or 15 Years in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Places of <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> I think 'twill not be much amiſs (for the more clear Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thereof) to ſpeak briefly, by way of Preface, ſomething of the
<pb facs="tcp:61482:5"/>
Four Parts of the World, and of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Principles appertaining to the Sphere, and Geography, to the end that the Reader may the more eaſily apprehend ſuch things as he ſhall find diſperſed here and there in theſe my Writings; laying down for certain and neceſſary Maxims ſeveral things which I ſhould otherways have been conſtrain'd, too often, to repeat; tho' but touching as it were upon what might be ſaid of this Science, the more exact Reſearch, and Knowledge of which, I leave to thoſe who make Profeſſion thereof, and who are more Learned therein than my ſelf, who deſire to know no more thereof than what may be neceſſary for me in the Narration of my Voyages.</p>
            <p>Know then that God hath ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Univerſe, that he hath joined the Earth and the Sea in one round Maſs, whoſe Weight repoſes in the Centre of the World, as being the loweſt Place, ſerving for a moſt ſure Retreat and convenient Habitation for Man and <note place="margin">Earth for Man and Beaſt.</note> Beaſt, in Parts raiſed above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which have their limited Place
<pb facs="tcp:61482:5"/>
in the Abyſms and Depth of the Earth. Now theſe Waters encompaſs all the Earth, and ſeparate it by an admirable Artifice into Three great and ſpacious Continents, or firm Lands, upon the which (according <note place="margin">Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents.</note> to the order and ſituation of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Parts of the World) the Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers place Five principal Circles, which are the Equinoctial, the Two Tropicks of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and the Two Polar-Circles, Artick, and Antartick. The firſt Circle is called Equinoctial, <note place="margin">Circle of the Sphere upon the Earth.</note> becauſe the Sun coming underneath the Circle, (which happens Twice in the Year, about the 21ſt. of <hi>March,</hi> and the 24th. of <hi>September)</hi> cauſes, throughout the whole World, Day and Night to be of equal length. It is equally diſtant from the Two Poles, and divideth the Terreſtrial Globe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Two Hemiſpheres, or equal Parts, one extending towards the North, and the other towards the South.</p>
            <p>The Second Circle is the Tropick of Cancer, or Solſtice of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe the Sun arriving there, cauſeth Summer to all the Countries on this ſide the Equinoctial, the which
<pb facs="tcp:61482:6"/>
happens at ſuch time as the Sun enters into the firſt degree of <hi>Cancer,</hi> which is about the <note n="*" place="margin">Stili no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi.</note> 22d. of <hi>June;</hi> and then we have the longeſt Days, and ſhorteſt Nights in the Year. The Circle is diſtant from the Equator 23 Degrees and a half towards the Border of the North.</p>
            <p>The Third Circle is the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> or Solſtice of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the Sun arriving, which is about the 23d. of <hi>December,</hi> cauſeth the ſhorteſt Days and longeſt Nights with us; for to the other Hemiſphere of the South happens the contrary. It has the ſame Declenſion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator towards the South as the other, to wit 23 Degrees.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Circle, is the Circle Artick, and the Fifth, Antartick; each of them diſtant from its Pole 23 Degrees and a half.</p>
            <p>Now by theſe Four laſt Circles, all the Earth is divided into Five Zones, <note place="margin">Zones.</note> or Girdles, which encompaſs and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Face of the Earth, one of which is called Torrid or Burnt, two Temperate, and two Cold. The Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid is ſituated betwixt the Two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
<pb facs="tcp:61482:6"/>
45 Degrees in breadth; one of the Temperate, Septentrional betwixt the Tropick, and Cancer, and the Circle-Artick; the other, Meridional, betwixt the Tropick and Capricorn, and the Circle-Antartick, of 43 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees each. The two Cold, are one betwixt the Circle-Artick and its Pole, and the other betwixt the Circle-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick, and its other Pole, each of 23 Degrees.</p>
            <p>The Torrid Zone, thus called by the Ancients, in regard of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they had, that becauſe of the Perpendicularity, and ordinary Neighbourhood of the Sun, all theſe Countries were uninhabitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the exceſſive Heats, alſo that the cold Zones were ſo, becauſe of the exceſſive Cold, cauſed by the great diſtance and lowneſs of this ſame Planet. But the Navigators of ours, and the precedent Ages, have by experience found all theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Habitable and Peopled; ſo that <note place="margin">Torrid Zone Inhabited.</note> ſome of the moſt Wiſe and Learned amongſt the Ancients, have left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them in their Writings more Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe according to Reaſon and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb facs="tcp:61482:7"/>
than by Experience<hi>:</hi> For in the Torrid Zone, the Heat of the Day is gently temperated by the Cold, equal with the Night; and in the cold Zones, the Air is mitigated in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by reaſon of the long Reſidence of the Sun in their Horizon; beſides the Cold there is rendred the leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, in regard there being very little or no Winds, and their Blaſts very feeble and weak. 'Tis true, the Countries under the cold Zones are ſcarcely Inhabited, becauſe the Earth does not there fructifie as in the Temperate. But as for thoſe of the Torrid Zone, there are vaſt Places wonderfully Peopled, as well for the Commodity of the Waters, as for the Goodneſs and Fertility of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which bear Grain, or Rice, in abundance, like the Countries ſubject to the King <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> towards the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope, Angoche,</hi> and the Cape of <hi>Currants,</hi> and the Country of the <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſines,</hi> or <hi>Preſter-John,</hi> which extends in Land from <hi>Bombaſe</hi> to the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Eaſtern Coaſt you have alſo very ſpacious Iſlands, as thoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:61482:7"/>
St. <hi>Lawrance, Zealand, Maldives, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra,</hi> the <hi>Java's, Moluque's,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without Number, extream fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and abounding in whatſoever is delectable, and neceſſary for Human Life.</p>
            <p>Towards the Weſt, are the Lands of <hi>New-Spain, Braſil,</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> and others adjacent, near to the Equator, which are very good. All which clearly ſhews the Falſhood of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the Ancients concerning the Habitation of theſe Zones.</p>
            <p>Now the Extent or Breadth of theſe Five Zones, from the Equinoctial to each Pole, is divided into Paralells, as their length from Eaſt to Weſt into Meridians; from whence is taken the Longitudes, and Latitudes of divers Countries.</p>
            <p>The Parallels are Circles equally diſtant one from the other, beginning at the Equator, and finiſhing at the Poles. The Meridians are Circles paſſing through the Poles, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Equator; or when the Sun is arrived, it cauſeth Noon to thoſe who are above the Horizon, and Mid-night to thoſe who are underneath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61482:8"/>
The Latitude of Regions is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the Parallels from North to South, as the Longitude by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians from Eaſt to Weſt: The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians of equal Extent, gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Two Poles; but the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels do not ſo, who are always equally diſtant one from the other, tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greater, or leſs, according to their Approach to the Equator or Poles.</p>
            <p>According to the Extent of theſe Circles, are taken the Longitudes and Latitudes of divers Countries and Places of the Earth. The Latitude, or Hieght, is counted from the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial to the Poles, from one part to another, by 90 Degrees<hi>:</hi> And the Longitudes, beginning at the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Fortunate Iſlands, or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> go from Weſt to Eaſt 360 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees quite round the Earth; in which 'tis Remarkable, that the Regions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Degree or Latitude what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, have in the ſame moment the like *Time, as thoſe who under divers <note place="margin">Weather or Seaſon.</note> degrees have Diverſity, and that in varying, in an Hour's time, by 15 Degrees, ſooner or later, according as

you are more Eaſt or Weſt. Thus thoſe who are under the ſame Degree of Latitude, tho' ſeveral of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, have Day and Night equally, and <note place="margin">Days and Nights di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> the ſame Seaſons on the one ſide the Equinoctial; for on the other, 'tis quite the contrary: like as if the Winter is in the Septentrional Part, you ſhall have the Summer in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridional, tho' in the ſame Latitude, as I have remark'd in the Kingdom of <hi>Canary,</hi> and <hi>Goa,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where they have their Winter in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> contrary to the ſame Latitude of our <hi>Europe:</hi> But this Winter conſiſts only in Rains, and great Winds coming from the South; and this Rain is very hot, inſomuch that the Winter in theſe Parts of <hi>Goa,</hi> is rather hotter than our Summer here, the Trees there being continually green, and bearing Fruit in all their Seaſons, as Jaquebar, Anana's, Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomes, Carambola's, Jambo's, and others; for all the Winter is hot and moiſt, and then the Sun ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, being hid under thick Clouds, ſo that it renders the Days very dark. But the Places who have divers Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb facs="tcp:61482:9"/>
have inequality of Days and Nights, more or leſs, according to their difference, and approaches, or diſtance from the Poles: The Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from Sun-riſing to the ſetting thereof.</p>
            <p>In the Countries under the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, they are equal with the Nights, of 22 Hours each; on the contrary, in thoſe Places ſtretching towards the Poles, they lengthen as in the 30th. Degree of Latitude, the longeſt Day being 13 Hours 5 Minutes; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the 50 Degree, 'tis 16 Hours, 20 Minutes; under the 66 and half, or in the Artick-Circle, 'tis 24 Hours intire; under the 70. the Sun ſets not, during 64 Days, and 14 Hours, as in thoſe Parts of <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> as I have heard a <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain ſay who has been there, that their longeſt Day, without Night, was from <hi>June</hi> to <hi>July,</hi> as in Winter they have Night proportionably; ſo that it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Ships which come from thoſe Countries to return in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> except they have a mind to be ſtopp'd by the Ice. The People who inhabit thoſe Countries, make,
<pb facs="tcp:61482:9"/>
during the Winter, little Holes in the Ice to take Sea-Wolves, tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are deceiv'd, and caught themſelves, as I have been inform'd; ſo that Multitudes of People have been ſwallowed up, the Ice coming to break on a ſudden, by reaſon the time or ſeaſon of the Heat approaches ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſooner than ordinary, the which has cauſed theſe People to be more circumſpect for the future.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo Remarkable; That the <note place="margin">Degrees and their Quantity.</note> Degrees of Latitude are always every where equal, each Degree containing 15 <hi>German</hi> Leagues, or 17 and a half of <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> 25 of <hi>French,</hi> or 60 <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Miles: But the Degrees of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude are equal with thoſe of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, under the Equinoctial only; and the more they decline there from, they diminiſh, until that under the Poles they are reduced into one Point: For under the Line, the Degree of Longitude contains 60 Miles, whenas under the 60 Degree of Latitude 'tis no more than Thirty, and under the Pole nothing at all. So that it ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:61482:10"/>
happen, that Two Ships being diſtant one from the other 150 Miles, if they ſail from the Equinoctial towards the Septentrion, being arrived under the 60 Degree, they ſhall be no more than 75 Miles diſtant, and under the 71 Degree, 31 Minutes, they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Fifty, and at laſt under the Pole ſhall meet.</p>
            <p>The Pilots ought well to obſerve this, in regard of the Currents which are found in certain Parts; ſo that thinking to make one way, they take another: Alſo I adviſe 'em to take heed they be not deceiv'd by certain Cards, which commonly are falſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they have been experienc'd by good Pilots. This happen'd to us in our Voyage to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the River of <hi>Cayenna,</hi> where the Caribes are, to the Iſles of <hi>Santa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the Iſle of <hi>Tobaco,</hi> and <hi>Trinidad,</hi> and caſt Anchor at the <hi>White-Iſland,</hi> where we could find no Water, of which we were in great want. 'Twas no ſmall Aſtoniſhment to me, how ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Multitudes of Cabrits, and wild Goats, (beſides other Animals which are there,) could live without ſo much as a drop of Water: But the Divine Providence has otherways order'd it, (as I have above-touched) by the cool Nights, and the Dew, with which theſe Beaſts refreſh themſelves.</p>
            <p>From thence we went to <hi>Margurite</hi> Iſland, but we found no more Water there than we did at the other, and ſo to the Mouth of the River of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana,</hi> where the People of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship had told us we ſhould find ſome, as we did at the entrance of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

ſpared not their neareſt Kindred for theſe abominable Sacrifices; and when any Man of Authority came to die, they interred with him their Slaves alive, to bear him Company in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World: When they had offer'd in Sacrifice their Enemies, they cut the Bodies into pieces, and then roaſt them, to feaſt with their Friends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.

At laſt after having viewed us well on all ſides, and taking notice of the Port, and faſhion of our Ship, they returned toward their Admiral, who was about 3 or 4.

This was no ſmall fortune for me, conſidering in what trouble they live in there; Beſides, the moſt part of the Portugueſe there are ſuch People who are carried thither by Force, being Condemned to be there for a certain time to make War upon the Moors; In ſhort, they are almoſt all Criminals, otherwiſe none would be forced to go there.</p>
               <p>Having then happily overtaken our Ship, our Captain for excuſe, let me underſtand, that he could not poſſibly wait any longer for me than until it was day, and if I had not been on Shore, he had ſet ſail the ſame night, knowing well that when I ſaw them under Sail I would haſt to overtake

them. But I believe the reaſon that moved him to go away ſo haſtily without me, was rather to Cheat me of ſome Money he owed me, and which he payed me ſince, againſt his Will, telling me of his Loſſes; but I was not bound to participate in them, foraſmuch as the Condition that I made with him was neither for Gain nor Loſs. But I could not get any thing of him ſince then, but by an Arreſt of the Parliament of <hi>Britagne</hi> in the year 1603.</p>

This Flemiſh Ship at the firſt diſcharge of her Cannon, had burnt all her Powder, with which a great number of her Men were diſabled and deſtroyed.

I was told that there was 4 or 5 others in a very bad condition, and ready to die: They were Burnt after a pitious and horrible manner. In the end, after we had well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with them, it was reſolved to ſend a Boat on Board the Enemies, with a Man that underſtood their Language, for they were Engliſh; which was done accordingly: But

they would be pacified by no means whatſoever, ſaying, that they had ſuffered a great deal of loſs, and that it was not their intention to do any harm to the French, that being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden them by the Queen their Miſtreſs: But that our Captain had given them ill Language, and that he himſelf muſt come on Board them to excuſe himſelf, which was done; And they came on Board us, with the Boats of their two Ships, ſearching in every corner, but they found nothing but Salt: If they had met with our Money, we ſhould have been in a bad condition; for they had played us a trick of their Trade. At laſt, after we had made them ſome Preſents of Victuals, they withdrew themſelves. Their Mariners and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers told us that they had reſolved to have fallen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon us in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and had Drank to one another, and Eaten all the little Refreſhment they had, hoping to have more of us; but God by his Mercy delivered us from them.</p>

All things that belong'd to him were preſently put to Sale upon the Deck, and every one Bought what he had occaſion for, as Coats, Linnen, and other Things, with which he was very well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: For he was of the Rank of the Nobility, and was named <hi>Duvall,</hi> of <hi>Vire</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi>

               <p>This done, we ſteered our Courſe towards the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and the <note place="margin">

They found but 12 Foot of Water, and our Ship drew already as many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the Keel touched Ground; but we had no harm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the River was Calm. Coming then to this Iſland, within the River of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rio del Oro,</hi> about five Leagues within from the Mouth, which is not taken notice of in the Map. We named the ſame, <hi>Touch Iſland,</hi> after <note place="margin">Touch-Iſland.</note> the Sirname of our Commander, the Sieur <hi>de la Ravardiere,</hi> where we caſt Anchor to tarry for ſome time. And the 15th of <hi>February</hi> we began to fit up our Patache, which was ready in our Ship, and only wanted Mounting and Chaulking.</p>
               <p>During this time we went daily to look for Shells, the fineſt in the world, and ſeemed as if they were enamel'd with Gold: As I put ſome of them into my Handkerchief, the Poiſon within, (which was like little Snails) ſtained it into a Purple colour; and <note place="margin">Sea Purple.</note> perhaps it might be the ſame <hi>Eſpece de Murex,</hi> ſo celebrated by the Antients,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61482:78"/>
and unknown at this time. We ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a great quantity of them for their Beauty. We caught alſo with our Nets, as much Fiſh as we could well find uſe for.</p>
               <p>This Iſland was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> full of <hi>Cormorants,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cormorants and their watch.</note> of which we killed a great number with our Harquebus ſhot. Of theſe Birds there is always one that watches when the others take their reſt, as 'tis ſaid of the Cranes. We had much ado to come near them, and were forced to creep along the Ground to take them. But after they began to be a little frighted with the Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes, they came no more as before.</p>
               <p>We tarried near a month in this place without ſeeing any Man; but about five or ſix days before our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, we perceived a Smoak in the Country, about three Leagues from us; which made us conjecture that there were ſome <hi>Lybians</hi> and Blacks <note place="margin">

               <p>It might be properly ſaid, that theſe Men came out of Hell, they were ſo burnt, and dreadful to look upon: We ſent then our Boat to know the cauſe of theſe Fires ſeen in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and found three of theſe Lybians, (of which 2 came on board our Ship) and one of them told me, that he was the Kinſman of <hi>Taquide Alforme</hi> of <hi>Cape Blanc,</hi> of whom I enquir'd news, foraſmuch as having heard of him in my former Voyage, towards <hi>Cape Blanc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the time that they faſted their <hi>Ramadan,</hi> and would not Eat any thing till night. 'Tis a great pity to ſee theſe People, how poor and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable they are, without Bread or-any other Food.

               <p>He that had ſtayed alone on Shore, was Son to one of theſe other two,

               <p>In all this Coaſt we could not find any freſh Water, nor before in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where we ſent our Boat to look for ſome, but in vain, all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being Deſart, and quite Barren This Iſland where we had caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, was directly under the Tropick of <hi>Cancer.</hi>

All theſe Iſlands are much ſubject to Storms and Boiſterous Winds, as it happened to us at this Iſle of <hi>Brava,</hi> where we loſt an Anchor, being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to weigh and drop Anchor ſo frequently there, when the Wind would drive us ſometimes towards Land, preſently again to the Sea. 'Tis ſuppoſed that theſe Winds are ſhut up there in ſome Gulf, as they come out at certain hours of the day. And what is more ſtrange, is, that a League from thence, the Sea was calm, and without Wind; which made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe Winds being ſo ſhut up, and come out with ſuch violence, have not the force to penetrate far, being ſtruck back, and repulſed by the Winds which come from the Sea.</p>
               <p>We could not find out the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Iſlanders; who are Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe, Meſtices, and Blacks: The Iſland bears Tobacco, abundance of Mace, and other Fruits.

After we had well refreſhed our ſelves with ſweet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Water, dried Fiſh, and other things, which the Iſlanders ſold us, we weighed Anchor to Steer our Courſe, and had the Wind ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, that we arrived at the Mouth of the River of the <hi>Amazons</hi> on <hi>Palm.</hi>

                  <hi>Sunday,</hi> about three hours before day. There are great Streams there about the Sea ſide, which run with a ſtrange ſwiftneſs and horrible noiſe, carrying along with them Trees and Plants, which they pluck up by the Roots along the Coaſt.</p>
               <p>We ſeeing our ſelves as ſoon as it was morning intangled amongſt theſe roaring Streams and Currents, having ſcarce any Wind, they who were up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>on the Watch began to cry out, that we were all loſt, thinking we had been upon the the Shelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At this noiſe every one began to ſtir himſelf to look out for help; and I hearing this word <hi>Loſt,</hi> mounted preſently upon the Deck to ſee if there was any way to ſwim, and if we were near Land, having no other way to ſave our ſelves but by Swiming till day, hoping to have ſight of Land, from
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61482:80"/>
which according to our Heights we were not far off. Hereupon the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot well advis'd, took the Plummet in Hand, and found in Sounding 25 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom; whereof being very glad, he cried out, that we were in the River <note place="margin">

We made but little Sail in expectation of the day, that we might ſee Land, which we ſaw the next morning; and Sounding again, we found but nine Fathoms, and ſo leſſening to three or four, and yet we ſaw no Land, which was a great trouble to us.</p>
               <p>On Monday we deſcried Land, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low towards the South Weſt, and by little and little we app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As we were thus wandring about, by good chance we perceived a Canoe <note place="margin">Encounter with Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> with 17 Indians, who came towards us, and went to our Patache which was before us, after that they came on board us: They were all naked,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61482:81"/>
and Painted, as they go in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, with their Crowns of Feathers; and told us that they came from War off the Cape of <hi>Caypour,</hi> one of the Capes near to the River of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> and they had ſome Booty in their Canoe. Their Captain ſeemed to be a Man of good faſhion, yet he was ſtark naked, and had only a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goutin, which is a little piece of painted Cotton, to cover his Privities. He ſpake with ſuch a Grace, that he might have been taken for a Man of Counſel; for he ſpake ſoftly, and gave a grace to all his Words and Geſtures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After we had diſcourſed with him <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Country of</hi> Yapoco.</note> about the Country, and where we ſhould Anchor, he left us two Indians for Guides, who conducted us to the Land of <hi>Yapaco,</hi> in the Mouth of the River, or very near, and cauſed us to ſhelter our Ship in a private corner, ſo that when the Tide went out, ſhe ſtuck upon the Mud; but the Tide coming in again raiſed her up.</p>
               <p>Arriving then in this Country of <hi>Yapaco,</hi> we left the River of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons</hi> on the left Hand, on the other ſide of which, towards the South, is

               </p>
               <p>Thirty or forty Leagues off from this great River, we found along the Coaſt a certain Rock, which had Veins of the colour of Slate, with ſome ſilver mixed amongſt it, out of which I took a little Stone I ſince loſt. We ſaw there alſo the marks of ſome Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Dutch Ship, that had paſſed by that way.</p>

               <p>We ſaw theſe Indians with two <note place="margin">Wood to ſtrike Fire.</note> little pieces of Wood ſtrike fire<hi>:</hi> I made the Experiment of it ſince to the late King <hi>Henry the Great</hi> at <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau,</hi> in the year 1605. All the Indians were run there from their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, and had trimed up their Hammocks, or hanging Beds, made with Wreaths of Palm-Trees; and

were in great numbers, Men, Women, and Children, all as naked as when they came out of their Mothers Bellies; except ſome Beads with which they decked their Bodies; and in their Ears they had long pieces of Wood and round Stones. They had brought a thouſand Trifles, as Gumbs, <hi>Egrets Feathers,</hi> and Parrots, Tobacco, and other Things which the Country af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.

like Beer or Citre: They chaw a certain Root, then Boil it, and after Strain it. There is another ſort of it more thick, which is made of Fruits and Palms, as big as a Gall-Nut, they bruiſe only the Bark which is upon them; it's as yellow as an Orange; for they make nothing of the Nut; after that they Boil and Strain it. They have another ſort, which might be taken for clear Milk, mixed with ſoft Cheeſe. I had a great mind to Taſte of it, beſides, being deſired by them to Drink, I would not refuſe, for fear they ſhould have thought that I intended 'em any harm; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they were mightily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee me Drink of it.</p>

               <p>I believe theſe <hi>Caripous</hi> are of all the Indians the moſt ſweet and mild in Behaviour: They are very curious of Honour, Ambitious to do Kindneſs to thoſe who viſit them: The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Girls, and Children, came very freely on board our Ship, without any ſhew of ſhame for their Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61482:85"/>
but were continually drawing their Legs cloſe, like Half-Moons. There was a little Indian brought me ſome Balls of Tobacco, with a little Caſe made of the Bark of a Tree, as wide as a Pocket, and as round as a Ring: It's that which the Men make uſe of to bind up their Privy-Parts; they can eaſily change them, or take them away when they pleaſe. I took two or three of them for curioſity, ſeeing 'em ſo ingeniouſly made. All the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians round about having heard the diſcharge of Cannon, came preſently from every quarter that was nigh, to exchange their Goods with our Knives, Hatchets, and other ſmall Ware.</p>
               <p>When the Cannon had fired, the noiſe of it continued near a quarter of an hour in theſe rough Woods, ſo that all the Country, Mountains, and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, were filled with the Eccho's, which anſwered one another with a wonderful noiſe, which might be heard as I believe, above 25 Leagues from thence.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt, theſe <hi>Caripous</hi> People are great Enemies to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribes,</hi> who make mortal War one <note place="margin">Caribes.</note>

                  </note> This little Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King of <hi>Yapaco</hi>'s, ſhewed me by ſigns, how the <hi>Caribes</hi> had great Teeth, and Biting his Arm, made me to underſtand that they Eat them when they happen to take them in War.

               <p>Being then amongſt theſe Savages, I ſaw one day amongſt others, the Captain of the Cannoes, whom we found at the firſt: He made me great Demonſtrations of Friendſhip by his Geſtures, ſaying, that he would bring me from his Country, (far from thence) ſeveral choice Things, and amongſt others, ſome little pretty Parrots, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Parrot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

My firſt thing was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Parrot as big as a Sparrow, with a long Tail, and very Tame, which would with a wonderful Pleaſure pick
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61482:86"/>
the Hair of the Beard, ſo that it could ſcarce be felt. I gave a little Knife in exchange for it. This Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taih who had promiſed me ſo many Rarities, came to offer me amongſt other Things, a Truſs of Serpents, <note place="margin">Serpents good to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I alſo took notice that theſe <hi>Caripous</hi> live better than theſe <hi>Caribes;</hi> for they know how to make Cakes with Mace, which are very good, and have other things to Eat, agreeable enough to the Country where they live.</p>
               <p>Theſe People Eat alſo another ſort of Serpents, like Adders, of a ſtrange greatneſs and length. This Country of <hi>Yapoco</hi> is above 120 Leagues from the Country of <hi>Toupinambous,</hi> which is towards the River <hi>Maragnon,</hi> or <hi>Braſil:</hi> And thoſe of <hi>Yapoco</hi> are of the ſame colour and ſwarthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion with the others, but they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61482:87"/>
are far finer, more lively, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
               <p>Speaking of this Captain, I will relate in this place a ſtrange and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable thing of theſe People, that the Nephew of <hi>Anacajoury</hi> told me, to whom the Soveraign Command of this Country belongeth, and becauſe of his Youth, his Uncle governed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſuch time as he ſhould be of Age to Rule. He told me, That they did Eat neither Fleſh nor Fiſh until <note place="margin">Strange Ceremonies to make Captains.</note> they had killed ſome of their Enemies; and when they had killed any one of them in War, they obſerved this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, which ſhould not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways agreeable to our French Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. They make a Link of Palm in which they put him whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for Captain, who before he may Eat either Fleſh or Fiſh, muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go therein the Exerciſe of their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; Then cauſing all the greateſt Captains of the Country to come, who with the King of the place, make one after another, a Harrangue or Speech to this new one, telling him, that he muſt be couragious, hardy, and nimble in Battel, and never give
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61482:87"/>
Ground but upon great occaſion, and with Judgment undergo all the hardſhips of War, be they never ſo great; and love the Virtue, Honour, and Reputation of a good and juſt Coptain. VVhen they have finiſhed this Diſcourſe, they take a great Switch in Hand, wherewith every one gives him three great Blows, with all their force, ſo that the Body is all over Black and Bloody, upon which Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may be ſeen to riſe as big as ones Finger; and ſo one after another make him the ſame Diſcourſe, repeating ſo many Blows with the Switch; which laſts a full Month, 3 or 4 times a Week. In the mean time this poor Patient in all that time Eats nothing but Caſaves and Potates, until he has had all his Ornaments of Virtue. And then they make a great Fire, putting thereon Green Leaves to make it Smoak, and alſo to hinder the force of the Flame; Then they have an <hi>Amica,</hi> or Hanging Bed after their manner, in which they put this new Captain, crowning him with Leaves; and there he muſt endure all the Heat and Smoak untill hr Swoon's away,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61482:88"/>
and ſeeing he ſcarce Breaths, they let the Bed down, and taking plenty of freſh Water, they caſt it upon him, untill he comes again to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as from Death to Life. All this being done, he is Honoured as a great Captain, and then they go a Cruiſing along the Coaſts to meet their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: After being upon their return to their Habitations, they make ſtill Remonſtrances to this new Captain, and give him each one, three Blows; and from thence forth he may Eat Fleſh. Sometime after that, they take another turn in the Sea with their Cannoes; and if they find any of their Enemies, they fail not to return to perfect this Captain, to whom they give three Blows more, and then he may Eat Fiſh; and ſo he is created and admitted into the Office, to bear Command over the others. But that is not done but to thoſe who have well behaved themſelves in Battle, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down many Enemies.</p>
               <p>I leave it to you, if our Men of War (who come to this Honour moſt commonly by the Purſe, than Virtue) would Buy that Honour at ſo dear a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61482:88"/>
Rate as theſe poor Savages do: Yet what I wonder at moſt of all, is, that <note place="margin">

               <p>As for my part, I ſaw almoſt the like in my return: For we had in our Ship three Indians, whom we brought into <hi>France,</hi> two <hi>Caribes,</hi> Brothers, and one <hi>Caripou,</hi> Nephew to the King of <hi>Yapoco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now one of theſe Brother <hi>Caribes,</hi> the leaſt named <hi>Atoupa,</hi> (we being <note place="margin">Atoupa</note> in the River of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> where the <hi>Caribes</hi> are) ſaid, He would go into <hi>France,</hi> but he thought the Ship was <hi>France,</hi> and called it ſo; but when we were to go away, he ſtrove with all his force to leap into the Sea, to ſave himſelf on Land; And we being at Anchor in the River, to hinder him we gave him in cuſtody to the <hi>Caripou Yapoco,</hi> their ſworn Enemy; ſo that at every ſtep that <hi>Atoupa</hi> took, <hi>Yapoco</hi> took another, following him up and down every where in the Ship, and bid us let him alone, and if at any time he were ſo bold as to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61482:89"/>
into the Sea, he alſo would be preſently after him, and make him Dive his Head to the bottom, to Drink to his Friends. This little <hi>Caribe Atoupa,</hi> not being above 14 or 15 years of Age, one day took a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Drown or Kill himſelf, as he could beſt have occaſion; and had caſt himſelf into the Sea had not he, who, ever had an eye upon him, catched hold of his Legs. When we were in the main Sea, his Brother held him continually Embraced, and in the night he tied him, but he was often found untied; and ſeeing that he could find no expedient to Drown or Kill himſelf, (for he was not ſuffered to get to any Knives, wherewith he might do himſelf a miſchief) one day finding a piece of ſharp pointed Wood, he ſtruck <hi>Yapoco</hi> ſuch a blow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon the Throat, that it ſliced away the Skin from one ſide of his Neck; which our General hearing of, cauſed him to be brought upon the Deck, and with a Whip made of Pack thread, tied to a Stick, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely Whipp'd, but he ſeemed as if he had not been touched, only ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61482:89"/>
up his Shoulders a little, without either crying out, or ſpeaking one word; which ſeemed very ſtrange to me, ſeeing him ſo marked with the Stripes he had received ſo ſeverely.</p>
               <p>But to return again to our Traffick in this Country of <hi>Yapoco,</hi> having made Exchange of all the Merchandize that could be found there, we took a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to go to the River of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cayenne <hi>River.</hi>
                  </note> where the <hi>Caribes</hi> are: But before our departure, the King of <hi>Yapoco</hi> came on board our Ship, with his Wife, his Siſter, and his Mother, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian <hi>Yapoeo</hi> whom we carried away with us, who was his Nephew, his Siſter's Son, in whoſe room the King <hi>Anacajoury</hi> governed, untill his Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which would be in a ſhort time. This Nephew told me, that he had almoſt received all the Orders of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, having undergone the ſame that all the others do who would attain to that Degree; and that he had been upon an Incurſion, and had already Eaten Fleſh, but not Fiſh, which was his laſt Ornament for the heighth of Honour. His Uncle, and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put him into our Hands, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61482:90"/>
deſired us by no means to ſuffer him to fall into the hands of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribes,</hi> their Enemies, nor the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, having heard of the Cruelty that they had exerciſed againſt thoſe <note place="margin">Spaniſh Cruelty.</note> of their Country, and of the bad uſage they had done to thoſe of <hi>Jucatan, Zempallan, Tlaxcallan, Panuco, Tecow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This King alſo deſired our aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Caribes,</hi> and that he would go with us, with his Naval-Army, which was ready prepared, as I have ſaid before; and that all the Booty that was taken ſhould be ours: But our General having a mind to Traffick ſairly with theſe <hi>Caribes,</hi> would not yield to his demand, only he promiſed to keep his Nephew ſafe, and that he would not aſſiſt the <hi>Caribes</hi> againſt him. This Nephew who went along with us, was drawn on by an Indian, Son to the King of the Iſland of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidad,</hi> that the Engliſh had taken by Subtillity, and who ſerved us for an Interpreter. It was the <hi>Millord-Ralle</hi> who carried him away in a Voyage; yet he did not underſtand fo well the Language of the <hi>Caripous,</hi> being at ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61482:90"/>
great a diſtance from them; beſides, it is a Language very particular, and different alſo from that of the <hi>Caribes,</hi> who have much ado to underſtand it, though they are not above 30 Leagues one from the other. Now this Indian Interpreter, having a mind to Marry one of the Daughters of <hi>Anacajoury,</hi> and already treated with the Father about it, had cauſed his Cloaths and other Things to be brought on Shore, telling this King that he would make War upon the <hi>Caribes</hi> with him, becauſe they had Eaten one of his Brothers; Of which our General be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſed, commanded him not to ſtir, ſeeing he was ſo neceſſary to us for the Language. He ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf detained by force, never reſted untill he had perſuaded <hi>Yapoco,</hi> this young Boy that we kept for Hoſtage, with one of his Brothers, telling him ſuch pleaſant Things of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> that neither his Mother, nor his Uncle could diſſwade him; ſo he came into <hi>France</hi> with us, where, upon his arrival he was ſet to turn the Spit, at which he was ſo offended, that he went away from <hi>Cancale</hi> to <hi>St. Malo</hi>'s,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61482:91"/>
without ſaying a word, but was thence fetched again: This was in the year 1604.</p>
               <p>Since, in the year 1613, upon my return from my Voyages to <hi>Paris,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">

Then he embarked in a little Ship with the Segnior <hi>du Bos,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> who was come from the Voyage that I made with Monſieur <hi>de la Ravardiere;</hi> but having been taken by the Pirates towards <hi>England,</hi> he found means afterwards to return into <hi>France,</hi> and went to find out Madam <hi>de la Ravardiere</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> where he had been before, the other Voyage, and told her News of her Husband, who tarried behind at <hi>Braſil.</hi> It happened that one day, a Hog falling into the Caſtle Ditch, this Lady commanded her Servants, and among the reſt <hi>Yapoco,</hi> to help to draw him out; but he, though born in the Country of the Savages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining a piece of work ſo vile and baſe, told her plainly, that he would not do it; upon which, the Lady giving him ſome harſh Language, he out of Anger went away without a farewel, and came ſtreight to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> where he found ſome <hi>Hablois,</hi> who brought him to the <hi>Havre,</hi> and from thence he went to <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61482:92"/>
When I had thus met with him, and Careſſed him, I carried him to my Lodging, where I treated him as well as I could: After that, I took him to the King, who deſired to ſee him: I cauſed him to Kneel before the King, who commanded me to ſpeak to him in his own Language, for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a little of it; Then he ordered ſome Money to be given him.</p>
               <p>After that, he was carried to the <hi>Havre,</hi> where Madam <hi>de la Ravar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diere</hi> ſent for him by her Servants, and ſince I heard no more News of him: Such was the Fortune of this young <hi>Yapoco.</hi>

               <p>But ſince we are ſtill near the River of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> before we part from thence, it will not be much amiſs to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61482:92"/>
ſay ſomething of it from what I was able to learn in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>Some have taken the River of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> or <hi>Oregliane,</hi> for that of <hi>Maragnan;</hi> but others will make two of them, and ſay, that their Mouths are diſtant ſome hundred Leagues; that of <hi>Maragan</hi> making the limits of <hi>Braſil</hi> on the Northen Coaſt, as the River of Plate, or Silver, makes the other Bounds on the South. All theſe Rivers come from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Peru,</hi> the higheſt, and of the difficulteſt acceſs of any others in the whole World.</p>
               <p>The River of the <hi>Amazons</hi> is very <note place="margin">
                     <hi>River of the</hi> Amazons.</note> broad in its Mouth, ſome 50 Leagues or thereabouts from one Shore to the other, and contains ſeveral great Iſlands.</p>
               <p>The Sea there runs at the hours of the Tide, being very ſwift in its Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and Flowing, and carries along with it many Trees and Plants it plucks up by the Roots, all along the Coaſts, which are like great Foreſts; for there the Coaſt being low, the Sea eaſily enters far up into the Country. The colour of this River inclines to a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61482:93"/>
dark grey: We found the Water of it Sweet 30 Leagues within the Sea. Within this River, about 30 or 40 Leagues up, are ſome Iſlands where theſe Warlike Women, the <hi>Amazons</hi>

                  </note> inhabit, who make War upon thoſe of the Continent of the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil;</hi> and on the other ſide, where the Indians inhabit, towards the Cape of <hi>Voyanpouc,</hi> are their Friends and conſtant Confederates. Theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for Propagation, have to do every year with the ſaid Indians in the month of <hi>April,</hi> and give them notice when they deſire to have them come to ſee them, all the Days and Hours of that month, and do not ſuffer the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to enter into their Iſlands more ſtrong than themſelves, ſetting ſome to guard the entrance, whilſt others paſs away their time, exchanging al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways theſe guards, by their turn, and ſo imploying all this Month of Love in the ſoft Careſſes of Joy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. <note place="margin">Month of Love.</note> At the end of the year, when their Confederates return to them, if they have Conceived in the mean time, they keep the Females, and give the Males to the Men, not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

them above a year; And 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that theſe Sons which they give to theſe Indians, may afterwards have to do with their Siſters and near Kinſ-Women; For they have a Cuſtom always to ſeek out the Children of thoſe they have had to do with. Now, though theſe Indians ſhould be all Married in the Continent, theſe <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons</hi> ſerve them only for Friends, and make Preſents to one another for a ſign of Mutual Love and Good Will. As to that which ſome ſay, that they wear but one Breaſt, and Burn off the other, according to the manner of the ancient <hi>Amazons,</hi> who inhabited towards the <hi>Thanais</hi> and <hi>Thermodon,</hi> they are nothing but Fables. 'Tis true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that theſe Women do on purpoſe loſe the Milk of one Breaſt that they may the better draw the Bow; and ſo perhaps this ſaying of the Ancients is to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>The Son of the King of <hi>Yapoco,</hi> amongſt other Things, told me, That theſe Women wear the Hair of their Privy-Parts very long, Combing them like their Heads, and that they are of a very great ſtature; adding alſo,

               <p>Behold what I was able to learn of theſe <hi>Amazons;</hi> which makes me not to give credit to all that we find writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of thoſe antient Women, ſo famous.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61482:94"/>
in the World. Since, <hi>Americus Veſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus,</hi> and others, made a fuller diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe Countries. In the year 1542, the French Captain <hi>Oregliane,</hi> ſent by <hi>Gonzale-Pizarro</hi> the Spaniard, found out the River which comes from the Province <hi>Atunquixo,</hi> thirty Leagues from the South Sea. He parted from <hi>Peru,</hi> and followed this River, deſcending above 400 Leagues in a ſtreight Line to its Mouth, and more than 1700 with the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and windings, finding many Peopled Iſlands.</p>
               <p>He was eight months in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, with a thouſand Perils and Incommodities; and reported, that he had found (upon a certain Rivulet here) Women Archers, which are of the <hi>Amazons:</hi> The Spaniards had Wars with them.</p>
               <p>Before this, <hi>Columbus</hi> in his ſecond Voyage had diſcovered theſe <hi>Amazons</hi> in an Iſle, which the Indians call <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dannina</hi> or <hi>Martinina.</hi> This Captain <hi>Oregliane</hi> gave his name to this great River of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> which he took for <hi>Maragnan,</hi> as the modern Navigators ſeem to agree: And indeed, they who
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61482:95"/>
were in the year 1612. in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Toupinambous,</hi> and in the Iſle of <hi>Maragnan,</hi> report, That there is no River there of this Name, but only a Creek or Bay, in which is this Iſle of <hi>Maragnan:</hi> This Name hath perhaps been the cauſe that this River towards <hi>Oregliane,</hi> or that of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,</hi> hath been taken for another River of <hi>Maragnan,</hi> though they are one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>But to return to our departure from the Country of <hi>Yapoco,</hi> to go towards <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parting from</hi> Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poco.</note> the <hi>Caribes</hi> Man-Eaters, we departed from thence on <hi>Eaſter-Day,</hi> the 15th of <hi>April</hi> in the year 1604. bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Coaſt, and our Ship running a-ground when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Tide went out, we were forced to ſtrike Sail, and caſt Anchor until the Sea floated us again. We run all along the Coaſt, which is very pleaſant, and filled with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of green Trees, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all theſe places very ſweet and agreeable.</p>
               <p>We had no ſooner approached the River of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> than we perceived a <note place="margin">Cayenne.</note> Cannoe, which came on board our Ship, and there was in it, one named
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61482:95"/>
                  <hi>Yago,</hi> Brother to <hi>Camaria,</hi> King of the <note place="margin">Caribes.</note> 
                  <hi>Caribes,</hi> who having ſpied the Nephew <note place="margin">Camaria.</note> of <hi>Anacajoury</hi> whom we had in our Ship, was mightily ſurpriſed at firſt, not knowing what to think of our coming with this <hi>Yapoco</hi> their Sworn Enemy. Nevertheleſs, he failed not to guide us in this River of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> which is very pleaſant, and convenient for Ships to abide in, being 5 or 6 Fathoms deep, in ſome places more, add others leſs. This <hi>Yago</hi> told us, That he knew well enough the King of <hi>Yapoco</hi> was preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to come and viſit them, and that they expected him within 3 or 4 days, as their <hi>Toupan</hi> or Devil had told them; which was true: For while we continued there for ſome days, at the end of 'em our General ſent ſome of his Men into the Country, with <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> their King; one of my Servants alſo went along with them, to procure me ſome of the moſt curious and rare Things he could find. Being come to a place where <hi>Camaria</hi> conducted them, 5 or 6 Leagues from thence, they found out, that <hi>Anacajoury</hi> had been there, with his Naval-Army,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61482:96"/>
and had waſted and burnt the Country, and carried away a great number of the Inhabitants from this Coaſt, and ſaw alſo how they ſerved their Enemies, who had been killed upon the place.</p>
               <p>They Eating them Roaſted, an <note place="margin">Cannibals <hi>or Man-Eaters.</hi>
                  </note> Indian Woman offered a roaſted Hand to our General, but he angrily refuſed it.</p>
               <p>Our General had already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them in the firſt Voyage, but having ſeen ſome of their Cruelties, would go there no more, yet he ſent ſome of his men, as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:</p>
               <p>My Servant being returned, told me, they made great lamentations at <hi>Camaria</hi> for the loſs they had ſuffered; and that <hi>Camaria</hi> thereupon was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ſuch a manner, that it was impoſſible to appeaſe him; yet he comforted them as well as he could, promiſing to order the Buſineſs ſo as to get into his Hands <hi>Yapoco</hi> the King <hi>Anacajoury</hi>'s Nephew, to make a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſt of him; and that they ſhould e're long have Revenge upon their Enemies, whom they would with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61482:96"/>
Joy Feaſt upon at their Pleaſure. There was an Indian Woman, who, knowing my Servant was a Surgeon, entreated him to Cure her of a blow of a Sword, ſhe had received upon her Head: But he perceiving that the Skull was ſplit, and the Brains to be ſeen, told her freely he could give her no help. There were ſeveral others wounded, to whom he did what help he was able.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was amongſt them, he told me, that one Night retiring with them into their Cabbins, (made of Branches of Palms) he ſaw the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies obſerved to their Husbands and Friends who had been killed in the fight.</p>
               <p>Firſt, An Indian Woman, ſitting upon her <hi>Amica,</hi> or Hanging-Bed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Song, very pleaſant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which continued a long time. That done, ſhe came to reckon up the <note place="margin">Ceremonies of the Dead.</note> Exploits of her Dead Husband, how he had Loved her, been Valiant againſt his Enemies, excellent in Drawing the Bow, able to undergo all the Hardſhips of War, and a thouſand other Gallantries and Perfections, of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61482:97"/>
which ſhe gave a particular account. After that, one of theſe Indians raiſed himſelf from his <hi>Amica,</hi> and went to deſire the others to lament; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they preſently fell to Howling ſo ſtrangely, that one would have thought them to be out of their Wits. Theſe Lamentations ended, they roſe up to make Merry with the Fleſh of their Enemies, with ſome Lizards and Crocodiles intermix'd, and all roaſted together, thus Feaſting upon the Graves of their Husbands and dead Friends, thinking themſelves thus to have obliged them. Thus much, my Servant told me, he had taken notice of concerning their Ceremonies to their departed Friends.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we Equipped our Boat, the 18th of <hi>April,</hi> to go to find out the end of the River of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> and know from whence it comes, and takes its head. We had with us two <hi>Indians,</hi> to ſhew us ſome Braſil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they make their Bows, and having taken with us a Barrel of Liquor, and ſome Biſquet for Victuals, we ſpent <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coaſt of the River of</hi> Cayenne <hi>and Voyage upon it.</hi>
                  </note> all the reſt of the day and the night in rowing along the Coaſt, which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61482:97"/>
is very pleaſant; and there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeveral ſorts of Birds making ſuch a noiſe, that it is a very dreadful thing to hear them.</p>
               <p>There is in every place a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Flies, like unto a ſort of Gnats, which are very troubleſome, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented us mightily both night and day, but eſpecially in the night time. The next morning we arrived at the end of this River, ſeeing a violent Stream that deſcended from a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain into a Valley, where it is below like a Lake, then comes to paſs upon a Rock very flat and broad, and from thence falleth down as into a hollow Ditch, which groweth wider by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, until it caſteth it ſelf into the Sea; the Tide comes up to the place where it beginneth to fall. We found no great matter in this Voyage, except ſeveral ſorts of ſtrange Creatures, and Indian-Hens of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort than thoſe of our <hi>Europe:</hi> The old ones carry their young, and would not fly away, ſeeing us, but were very tame. Theſe Hens have Feathers upon their Heads which are black and very beautiful, and like
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61482:98"/>
to thoſe of a Heron. We carried ſome of them to our Ship, but we could not preſerve them all until we came into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, we found all this Coaſt Deſart; and being returned on Board, we told what we had ſeen in this Voyage: Our General ſent us again to diſcover another River, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates it ſelf from that of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> and runs towards the South-Eaſt.</p>
               <p>We prepared our Boat, with ſome Indians, thinking it had not been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far off, or elſe not well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Interpreters, inſomuch that we took not Victuals enough with us, only I furniſhed my ſelf with ſome Biſquet, acd gave of it to one of our Indians, who was very glad of this Proviſion that I had made.</p>
               <p>Having then Rowed a good way up into this River, we found nothing but Branches of Trees, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a manner all the paſſage, ſo that we were forced ever and anon to lie all along in the Boat, to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath theſe Branches of Trees, which were laded with Oyſters. At laſt we came to a certain place where
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61482:98"/>
there were Trees cut down by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſome Ships that had been there before us. Theſe were exceeding <note place="margin">Red-Wood.</note> great, and the Heart very red like unto Braſil, yet it was not ſo as I have experienced it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Indian whom I had given the Biſquet to, did not mind to follow our Men, but ſought for ſomething to live upon, and came again preſently towards me, ſhewing me by Signs, he had found ſomething good for us, and went to find out the Wooden-Bowl of the Boat, which ſerved only to caſt out the Water; ſo led only me along with him, a good way into the Wood, to a Tree cut down, which was hollow, and had in it a Bee-Hive, the moſt excellent, clear, ſweet and agreeable that could be imagined. This Honey was of a Jelly, like Oil, and exceeding clear, of a greeniſh colour, and encloſed in Bags, like thoſe great Purſes the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants uſe, wherein there is ſeveral lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Leather ones. There the Honey is environ'd with a Membrane or Skin, which is the <hi>Criſis,</hi> very clear: When this little Skin is broke, the Honey
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61482:99"/>
comes out of this only, and not the others; ſo the Indian broke one after another, throwing the Honey into the Bowl, which he gave me to drink of as a choice Liquor.</p>
               <p>Having taken ſome of it in this manner, he went to look for Water to mix with it, to the end that we might have the more of it, as alſo to quench our Thirſt the better.</p>
               <p>In the mean time our Companions were in another place, on the other ſide of this Wood, ſeeking for the Braſil-Trees. I ſaved ſome of this Honey in the Bowl, not having elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to put it: But our Thirſty Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple returning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from this Wood, and taking the Bowl to Drink, mixed Water with the Honey, and ſo drank it up; which cauſed me to Quarrel with out Carpenter who had done it on purpoſe, like a Man of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where they are born to Envy and Malice. I bore the loſs of this Honey, ſo excellent, as patiently as poſſibly I could, becauſe our Lieutenant was there, who had not a mind to do what this bold Carpenter did, but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61482:99"/>
had taken Water with his Hand out of the River to Drink.</p>
               <p>I could never ſince find any more of this ſweet Liquor, by whatever Signs I could make to the King of the <hi>Caribes,</hi> to cauſe him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it was; for he did not know the name of it. But what I wondered at moſt, was, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian could ſo eaſily find out this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in theſe Woods, ſeperating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the others for that reaſon. If I could have ſaved only 3 or 4 Ounces of it, I would not have parted with it for any thing whatſomever, but would preciouſly have preſerved it, to make a Preſent thereof to the late King my dear Maſter; as I gave him ſome of that which I brought from <hi>Africa,</hi> which he found of an excellent Taſte, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Honey of</hi> Africa.</note> and cauſed me to lay it carefully up in his Trunk, as they do in the ſame Country from whence I had brought it. This Honey of <hi>Africa</hi> was as white as Snow, clear, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good Taſte; alſo the King confeſſed, that he had never before ſeen any ſo excellent: But that was but courſe Honey in compariſon to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61482:100"/>
this of the Country of the <hi>Caribes.</hi> The Bees which make this Honey in the <hi>Weſt-Indians,</hi> are of a pale and yellowiſh colour, little and harmleſs, and are not troubleſome at all, as I found out in the place whence I took this Honey, which was like to a moſt precious Balm, and I believe, that as the Honey of <hi>Africa</hi> is excellent for Healing of Wounds, ſo this of the <hi>Indies</hi> quite exceeds it every way, as in its conſiſtence, taſte, ſmell and colour.</p>
               <p>Being then returned from this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where we could diſcover nothing to ſerve our turn, our General was reſolved to ſend me vvith the King <note place="margin">Another Voyage to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribes.</note> of the <hi>Caribes,</hi> to go to their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and look in the Woods, to ſee if vve could there find a certain Tree, vvhich is a ſort of Wood of Aloes, <note place="margin">Aloes Wood.</note> called by them <hi>Apariebou,</hi> for vve had found of it in the Country of <hi>Yaposo.</hi> For this effect, I parted the 29th of <hi>April,</hi> vvith <hi>Cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61482:100"/>
runs about two Leagues up into the Country, and was very narrow, the Branches of Trees quite covering it, ſo that we had a thouſand Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, and much ado to lie flat down in the Boat to avoid 'em. The Indians being ſtark Naked did not matter it ſo much; for if theſe Branches had made them tumble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River, they knew ſo well how to Swim, that they would not have much needed to fear: That which did us the moſt harm, was, that ſome of theſe Branches were laden with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Oyſters, little, and of the colour <note place="margin">Oysters.</note> of Pearls, of a very good Taſte; for I was willing to try, opening ſome before theſe Indians, who wondered mightily to ſee me open 'em ſo eaſily, not knowing how to do it.</p>
               <p>We went thus Rowing along to find out their Dwellings, that at laſt coming to the end of the River, we went on Shore, and about a League and a half from thence, we ſaw one of their Habitations, and the <hi>Caribes</hi> came about us, offering to their King, Fruit, and other Things to Eat, with which he alſo preſented me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61482:101"/>
that, we left this Habitation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued our way towards that of <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi> When we were come to the foot of a Mountain, this King fell a crying out as loud as he could, and deſired me alſo to do the like, which I did, and I believe that it was to call home all thoſe who were about the Woods, becauſe thereupon they preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Habitation; for I ſaw them run from all parts to their place, which was in a Valley, where being come, I found a great number of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribes,</hi> Men and Women; amongſt the <note place="margin">

All theſe Indians, Men and Women, naked as they were, came running to ſee me and my Companion, a young Carpenter of our Ship, who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mortal apprehenſion that they would Eat him, deſiring me mightily to give them ſomething of that which I had brought to exchange with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then I commanded them to make <hi>Ovato Courende,</hi> which is to ſay, a good Fire, becauſe we had been Wet with the Rain, by the way, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians did not much matter, being
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61482:101"/>
not much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> troubled to dry their own Cloaths: They preſently made me a a Fire, it being very late at night, ſo that we were pretty well dried in this great Hall where all theſe Indians were; and thus we Supped with the King and his Wife, in the ſight of all the others: They made mighty much of us with their Savage Victuals. I had brought a Bottle of Wine and ſome Biſquet with me, which was no ſmall help to us, after ſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues by the way, troubleſome with Water and Woods, where ſometimes the Indians were forced to carry me upon their Backs in certain places that were very hollow.</p>
               <p>After Supper, the King cauſed us <note place="margin">Amacas <hi>or Hanging Beds.</hi>
                  </note> to retire into his Houſe, where he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two Amica's or Beds to be hung up for me and my Companion. They had put my Bed ſo, that it joyned to the King's, and my Companion's a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle higher; and that of the Queen's was on the ſame ſide with the King's; and all the night there was Guards which kept a Fire near the King and me. Our poor Carpenter did nothing elſe but tremble all the night long,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61482:102"/>
thinking every moment they were coming to Eat us.</p>
               <p>The King <hi>Camaria</hi> in the mean <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>As for my part, when he talked to me after this manner, I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him, but gave him the hearing, and promiſed, if I could, to do all he deſired: And he told me that he would willingly give all he had to have this poor <hi>Yapoco,</hi> and that I would take care to have him delivered up, which I durſt not refuſe him.</p>
               <p>I thought this Night very long, ſeeing alſo that the Queen, Wife of

                  <hi>Camaria</hi> did not ſleep. I roſe up two or three times to go out of the Houſe, continually ſuſpecting the Malice and Cruelty of theſe <hi>Anthropaphages,</hi> and <note place="margin">Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phages, <hi>or</hi> Cannibals.</note> Eaters of Human Fleſh: Beſides that, I perceived in the middle of this Houſe, a Toad of the ſtrange and <note place="margin">Wonderful Toad.</note> moſt horrible bigneſs that ever I ſaw; and I believe that it was rather ſome Devil than a Toad, becauſe <hi>Camaria</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caribes <hi>ſpeak with the Devil.</hi>
                  </note> often ſpoke with the Devil, to know what their Enemies were doing.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as it was day, I preſently roſe up to know what we had to do, and <hi>Camaria</hi> ſhewed me his Throat, which was very much out of order by a Cold that he had.</p>
               <p>I carried him with me into the Woods to ſeek for Herbs fit for his Diſeaſe, and uſed my utmoſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome Honey to compoſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for him; but he could neither underſtand me, or comprehend what I demanded of him. At laſt, having Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted, we went along with ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to look for Wood of Aloes. This is a Tree of an extraordinary bigneſs, bearing Leaves like a Fig-Tree, but a little greener: The Tree contains in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61482:103"/>
its Heart a black Wood, very oiley, ſharp, and of a very good Odour; And a Tree as big as a Tunn ſhall have in its Heart but a very little quantity of this black Wood. This Tree is very hard, and where it is black, 'twill ſink to the bottom of Water like a Stone. We laded thereof about 35 Tuns, which are 70000 pound weight or thereabouts. We laded Store of 2 or 3 other ſorts of Wood, one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a Red-Sandal, and the other a Cittern, and partly of the ſame Odour. It is of a very ſweet Scent when firſt cut, but by ſucceſſion of time it comes to loſe its Odour. I have learnt that this black Wood is certainly a ſort of Wood of Aloes, but not ſo ſweet-ſcented as that of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> becauſe it comes ſo far upon the Sea, receiving thereby a certain Saltiſh quality. But at ſuch time as I was at <hi>Goa,</hi> being in an Enſarail where the Idolaters Work, I there ſaw ſome Wood of Aloes of the River of <hi>Ganges,</hi> which was ſweet, and had almoſt the ſame qualities as that of the Weſt, as I ſince found out by curious <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Virtue of the Wood of</hi> Aloes.</note> Experience. The Gentiles told me
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61482:103"/>
that this Wood was very excellent and odoriferous, and neither Rotten nor Worm-eaten, and was chiefly a good Remedy for the Head-Ach, or the Ague. For the Head-Ach, you muſt rub this Wood againſt a flat Marble, agitating it with Roſe-Water, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; then rub the Forehead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And for the Ague, drink Water thus agitated, taking 2 or 3 Ounces. This Virtue is not found in that Wood of Aloes which is brought us, becauſe it is quite Rotten and Worm-eaten, having in it no other Virtue but for the Perfumes, and very little for Medicine; So that I adviſe all curious Apothecaries to chuſe for the good and right Wood of Aloes, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>True Wood of</hi> Aloes.</note> which is ſharp, joined with a certain bitterneſs. As for the colour, the beſt is that which is black, enclined to grey with Veins, very hard and ponderous, rendering a ſweet-ſcent in the burning, and above all very Gummy. Theſe are the marks of the beſt as far as I could take notice of in my Travels. I know very well that the price thereof is a little high, and that is the reaſon why it is ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61482:104"/>
ſeldom kept in Shops, where they have inſtead thereof the Sandal-Cittern, which is of a quite contrary Faculty and Vertue: And ſo likewiſe of the Turbit <note n="*" place="margin">Which is a Root.</note>, of which they chuſe more of that which is white, light and falling to Powder in the breaking, (than the grey) which is of a ſweet ſcent, gummy and heavy, which is the good and right, as I have ſeen at <hi>Goa,</hi> where they gather it. The Indians themſelves never make uſe of any other ſort than the grey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to white; but one Dram of that will make more in effect than three of the other; and I believe that this white is not the right Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, never having ſeen any ſuch in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but that it rather comes from <hi>Perſia,</hi> becauſe 'tis brought from <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the Caravans which come from <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> Thus much can I ſay at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the right Turbit. As for the reſt, the Indians call this Wood of Aloes <hi>Aupariebou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61482:104"/>
We gathered then together, in the River of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> ſtore of this Wood of Aloes, which was very good and excellent: but the quantity that hath been found thereof, greater than has been hitherto ſeen, hath been the cauſe that it is not ſo much eſteemed as formerly; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the able and learned Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Tours, Poitiers, Angiers, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle,</hi> and other Cities, have bought it of me at ten, fifteen, and twenty Sols the Ounce. I believe that if this Wood of Aloes of the Weſt was dryed and cut twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, like that of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> where the beſt grows, that it would very much reſemble it in Virtue, Colour, and Odour: But in regard I brought it green as it was, the ignorant Apothecaries thought it was not the right Wood of Aloes.</p>
               <p>But to return to this River of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenne,</hi> there is, in the middle of it, a little Iſland, about 100 Paces in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, where a great number of Birds, from all parts thereabouts, come to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61482:105"/>
take their reſt at night; and amongſt others, ſome of thoſe beautiful Birds have Carnation Feathers quite to the Bill: and having a mind to carry ſome of them alive with me into <hi>France,</hi> I ſtrewed Bird-lime all over this little Iſland, (for I had brought 9 or 10 Pounds of it from <hi>France)</hi> and the next day ſome of our Men went there, who found a great number of them taken; But as the ill fortune would have it, they tarried not till I could ſee them, (for I was then in the Ship) but Eat them all up, like Gluttons as they were, which I was mightily vexed at.</p>
               <p>Theſe Birds are of the bigneſs of a Crane, and are at firſt of a Dove co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, then in growing, change by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little into a Carnation: The Indians make their Garments of them, and Crowns of Feathers for their Heads: And it is a fine ſight to ſee them thus array'd, painting alſo their Bodies with <note n="*" place="margin">Zinzolin, <hi>or Red the colour of the</hi> Indians.</note> a reddiſh colour, which is that they uſe to Paint themſelves withall: This is made of a little Seed incloſed in a Veſſel of the Faſhion of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61482:105"/>
                  <hi>Alquequangi,</hi> a little Plant which grows commonly in the Vinyards; They are called <hi>Coquelourdes,</hi> and are filled full with theſe little red Seeds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they Paint themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, we ſet theſe <hi>Caribes</hi> to work, and employed them in looking out the Wood of Aloes, and gave them a Hatchet or Bill for a piece or two of this Wood; and when they had prepared a piece, they came to give me notice of it, to know if it was neat, and peeled of from the white Wood which is round about it, and hath in it neither Force nor Virtue.</p>
               <p>They ſet ſeveral Men to trail a piece of this Wood to the Sea ſide; for it is very heavy: Then they choſe which they liked beſt, a Hatchet or a Bill, to exchange for their Wood. I ſaw one of theſe <hi>Caribes,</hi> who was mightily puzzel'd, and in great doubt, which of the two he ſhould chuſe, and was a long time conſidering and pauſing with himſelf which would be the moſt neceſſary for him; at laſt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61482:106"/>
after having well conſidered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf, he took the Hatchet, ſeeing he who gave it him began to be angry for his ſtanding ſo long about it. They brought us alſo, to Sell, an abundance of Fruits, as Anano's and Plantins, which are long Figs, and as big as a Cervela, with Patato's, and other Things good to Eat; Alſo ſome <note place="margin">Cervelas.</note> Crocodiles, and a ſort of an Animal, armed with a Coat, which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards call, <hi>Armadille.</hi> I made the <note place="margin">Armadille</note> Diſſection of a Crocodile, and Eat ſome of it's Fleſh, which is pretty good, only it is a little ſweet and unſavory, though I had well Salted and Spiced it.</p>
               <p>I had alſo in exchange, of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another ſort of a Creature, which is a kind of an Ape or Marmot, but <note place="margin">Apis.</note> more Arch and Roguiſh, and with a very long Tail.</p>
               <p>The Indians ſay that this Beaſt carries her young ones upon her Back when ſhe has caſt them out of her Belly, and goes jumping from Tree to Tree with them upon her Reins;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61482:106"/>
and when any one of them is ready to fall, ſhe holds them up with her Tail.</p>
               <p>This Animal makes ſuch a noiſe about the Woods, that when they are together tho' never ſo few, you would ſay there were a hundred Hogs a kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>That which I bought was Dead, and coſt me a little Horn: It was a Female, having two Teats in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach like a Woman. The Indians had taken it with the Bow, and it had a ſtroke with an Arrow in the Belly, and carried one of her young ones upon her Back; which they brought us to Sell for a Hatchet. This little one, being in our Ship, howled after ſuch manner, that it made us all quite Deaf; it died afterward, for it would not Eat.</p>
               <p>There happened to be a Monkey at that time in our Ship, and this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture catching faſt hold about its mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, griped it ſo hard, that the poor Monkey could not ſhake it off, running about the Cordage from one ſide to another, and endeavouring with his Paws to make her fall, but in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:61482:107"/>
We had another Animal, the ſtrangeſt that can be imagined; for it had a very long Beard, the Head ſet up very high, and the Legs very long, with three Paws behind and two before: It kept it ſelf continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a Ball, not being able to ſtand upon its Legs. We tied a Rope croſs the Ship, and then put this Beaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but ſhe continued always in a round<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like a Ball. That which was given it to Eat, ſhe took in her Paw like a Monkey, and ſo put it in her Mouth. We had many ſtrange Creatures, which it would be too long and tedious, to give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of.</p>
               <p>I return then to ſome Manners and Faſhions that I have obſerved amongſt theſe <hi>Caribes.</hi> A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our departure from this River of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> we ſaw one day theſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribes,</hi> leading a new Bride about the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Manner of the</hi> Caribes <hi>in their Marriages.</hi>
                  </note> Woods with a very great noiſe, and purſued and killed all that they found about the Foreſt. Then they came to the Sea ſide to ſee our Veſſels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:61482:107"/>
Theſe are People of a very good Stature, and Plump. They ſat down upon the Bank of the River to view our Ship at their leiſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Bride was there, all alone, with a company of theſe Savages, and having continued there ſome time to ſee us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, ſhe again roſe up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the others conducted her about the Woods as before: Thus they lead about their Wives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Kindred, and Friends. As I kept Watch one night upon the Deck, I ſaw theſe <hi>Caribes</hi> upon a high Mountain keeping alſo Watch, and Sounding with a Horn very loud; then all the other Habitations anſwered, in the ſame manner, every hour of the night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After that they made a clear Fire, which they preſently put out again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They do all this that they might be thought not to Sleep; for they mightily fear their Enemies the <hi>Caripous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now our Ship being laden with <note place="margin">Another Voyage of the Author.</note> as many Commodities as we were well able to procure, and being ready to ſet Sail, I took a Reſolution, the 17th of <hi>May,</hi> to go once again towards their Habitations with ſome
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61482:108"/>
ſmall Ware, as Knives, Combs, and other Things; and gave all theſe to an Indian, to carry in a little Basket, who was wonderfully pleaſed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me; but he, being ſubtile and ſly, would not march before me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it did not belong to him to go firſt; which made me not a little wonder that this Indian could know what Honour was due to another; But, the Raſcal did it, that he might the more eaſily put his Hand into my Basket and ſharp ſomething out; I perceived it happily, turning my ſelf about, and ſo caught him in the very act; upon which I ſhewed him gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>that</hi> was neither handſome nor well done: He excuſed himſelf as well as he could and then went before me until he found in the Wood a little Way or Path, on the right Hand, which went ſtraight to his Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then he returned me my Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, not being able to retain him for all I could do; I gave him a Comb, for his Labour, of which he was very glad. I do not know but that he had caſt ſomething aſide of what he had taken out of my Basket.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61482:108"/>
I proceeded on my way untill I came to a high Mountain where there were, a great number of <hi>Caribes,</hi> with their Wives and Children: There by chance I found the Indian, our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, who helped me mightily in making my Bargains, for what I wanted, as well for Parrots as other kind of Animals. Having exchanged what I deſir'd theſe Indians led me into another Habitation, where I ſaw, <hi>Yapoira,</hi> the Brother <hi>Caribe</hi> of <hi>Atupa</hi> who was in our Ship: He was upon <note place="margin">Yapoira.</note> the top of one of their Houſes of Palm, and as ſoon as he perceiv'd me, he caſt himſelf down, and came to embrace me, remembring that <hi>I</hi> had given him a Hatchet when he had broke his own in our Service.</p>
               <p>He ſpoke to me of his Brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toupa</hi> and that his Mother had no more than this little Boy who was all her Comfort; That the <hi>Caripous</hi> had killed all his Brothers and Siſters, and that, if our General would let him return to his Mother, he himſelf was content to go with us into <hi>France. I</hi> told that he ſhould go along with me, to make his Remonſtrances, which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61482:109"/>
he did: <hi>I</hi> asked him for ſome Water, which they call <hi>Tonna,</hi> and preſently he cauſed his Wife to bring me ſome, who was of an extraordinary ſweet Nature, and very handſome, though ſhe was ſtark Naked: Having drank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cauſed me to enter into a great Hall made of Palms, where they keep themſelves in the day time, with their Amaca's, to hold Counſel concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affairs of War. Then they led me into a certain Houſe where there was a great many Women and Girls ſtark naked; and put ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato's upon the Fire for me to Eat; and having made ſome exchange, as well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Mace and Patato's, as Gums, which is a black Bitume which they Chaulk <note place="margin">Gums.</note> their Cannoes with, <hi>I</hi> laded 2 or 3 Indians, and ſo we returned, towards the Port, to our Ship. I had a great deal of trouble in returning back be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Savages led me through the Wood where there was a great many Waters to paſs; beſides it rained, and was very bad Weather. After we had gone 2 or 3 Leagues of this bad way, we came to the end of a little River, and found a Cannoe on
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61482:109"/>
Land that wanted only to be ſet a Float, but we had no Oars; yet theſe Indians looked ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> long amongſt the Herbs that at laſt they found out ſome that were hid. Theſe Oars are very little, and like to a Battle-dore which they beat Hemp withall.</p>
               <p>Being thus Embark'd, we Rowed ſo hard that we ſoon arrived at our Ship, where they waited for me with great earneſtneſs, not knowing where I ſhould be kept out ſo late, and they were to have ſet ſail the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as we did.</p>
               <p>But before we come out of this Country, I will not forget, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Rarities that grow there, there are certain Gums to be found, called <hi>Copal,</hi> and <hi>Anime,</hi> and certain <note place="margin">Animes <hi>Gums.</hi>
                  </note> Bitum, or black Gum, very Odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous when it is put upon the Fire; It is alſo good for the Rhume, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Smoak of it; the ſame is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Anime,</hi> which is a Gum, yellow and tranſparent, like the Gums of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and is found in great Tears.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Copal,</hi> it hath not this quality, but it ſerves for <note n="*" place="margin">Swellings.</note> Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes, to ripen and heal them, ſo
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61482:110"/>
they come from a cold Cauſe and Phlegm. For, as for thoſe which come from Heat and Blood, the <hi>Copal</hi> is not ſo proper to apply, being it is hot. This <hi>Copal</hi> is a White Gum, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to gray: The Tree which bears it is like to a Lawrel in its Leaves, but 'tis bigger in the Trunk, and hath alſo young ones. I picked out ſome of this Gum, by making an Inciſion in the Tree; then the next morning, or two days after, I found the Gum pure and clear upon the ſlit. The <hi>Anime</hi> is gotten after the ſame manner, and its Tree alſo reſembles the other. As for the Bitum, or black Gum, it comes from a place where there are Springs of Water, and it is gathered, mixed with Earth at the foot of certain Trees amongſt Green Moſs. The Indians make uſe of it, inſtead of Pitch, to Chalk their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes.</p>
               <p>As for the Language of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I will only ſay, that it is of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Language of the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribes.</note> ſeveral ſorts; and that of the <hi>Caripous</hi> is ſomething different from that which the <hi>Caribes</hi> ſpeak, and have much ado to underſtand other, although they are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61482:110"/>
not far diſtant. Theſe <hi>Caribes</hi> were mighty deſirous to know, of us, what it was that we Worſhipped in Heaven; whether it was the Sun, which they call <hi>Occayou,</hi> or the Moon, which they name <hi>Nona,</hi> the Stars <hi>Cherica,</hi> Heaven <hi>Capa,</hi> the Clouds <hi>Canopa;</hi> as for the Fire, they call it <hi>Ovato,</hi> Water <hi>Tonna,</hi> the Sea <hi>Parano,</hi> the Woods <hi>Vropa,</hi> the Mouth <hi>Pota,</hi> the Eyes <hi>Onou,</hi> and the Hair <hi>Omchay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as for the Religion of all theſe <note place="margin">Religion of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> People of <hi>Braſil,</hi> and amongſt others the <hi>Caripous</hi> and <hi>Caribes,</hi> they live without Faith and Law, and without any certain Belief of a Divinity, true or falſe; not Worſhipping Idols, nor any thing whatſoever: only they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome kind of an Immortality of the Soul. They ſpeak much of a God, which they call <hi>Toupan,</hi> which is ſome <note place="margin">Caribes <hi>deal with the Devil</hi> Toupan.</note> Devil with whom they have Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and exerciſe ſeveral ſorts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination and Witchcraft: And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we were told that when <hi>Camaria,</hi> King of the <hi>Caribes,</hi> had a mind to know any thing concerning their Wars againſt their Enemies, he made made a hole in the Ground, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61482:111"/>
ſome certain Words, and then came ſomething up with a horrible thundering noiſe, which ſpake to him, and inſtructed him, giving him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what their Enemies were doing at that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>time. And indeed, when <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> and his Brother <hi>Yago</hi> came on board our Ship, they told us, that they knew very well, that their Enemy <hi>Anacajoury,</hi> King of the <hi>Caripous,</hi> was preparing himſelf to come to attack them; that which he could not have known ſo readily but by ſuch means.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Caripou-Yapoco,</hi> of whom I have ſpoken before, that <note place="margin">Yapoco.</note> 
                  <hi>Camaria</hi> King of the <hi>Caribes</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſired me (being at his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biration) to order the buſineſs ſo with our General that he might have him in his power, to Eat him in Revenge of the miſchief that his Uncle <hi>Anaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joury</hi> had done them before: VVhen I was returned back to our Ship, I ſpoke to the General about it, who told me, that I did very well to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but he would take care to avoid ſuch VVickedneſs: Thus <hi>Camaria</hi> was promiſed to have <hi>Yapoco</hi> given him, of which he was mighty Joyful, and ſent
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61482:111"/>
about all his Country, to all his Friends and Confederates that they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves to come to this Feaſt. The next morning hoiſing our Sails, and weighing Anchor to go away, preſently comes <hi>Camaria</hi> with a great many Indians to have <hi>Yapoco,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuſed him in good earneſt, went away ſo affronted and vexed that I had not a mind to return to be his Gueſt; for I believe they would have done the ſame to me they deſigned to do to the poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Yapoco.</hi> This <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> had but one Eye, and was mighty Crafty and Treacherous.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Yapoira,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Atou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> the <hi>Caribe,</hi> who had tarried all night in our Ship as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>Atoupa</hi> did all that ever he could to perſuade us to let go his Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſeeing he could not obtain that of our General, he ſaid that he would alſo willingly go with us into <hi>France,</hi> and that he would either kill or drown himſelf rather than leave him. The General told him that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and that he ſhould come betimes in the morning, and whilſt he was in ſuch a good Humour: This being
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61482:112"/>
thus reſolved upon, as ſoon as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſet ſail, we ſaw the Mother of theſe two <hi>Caribes,</hi> who came towards us in a Cannoe, crying and howling after the moſt pittiful manner that could be imagined; She brought along with her the Bow and Arrows, the Paintings and the Amica, of <hi>Yapoira,</hi> which is all their Wealth. <hi>Yapoira</hi> was mighty ſorry to ſee his Mother keep ſuch a mourning for him, and deſired our General to give her a Hatchet, to appeaſe her a little, which was done; yet ſhe returned again thus Diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
               <p>After that we ſet ſail the 18th of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Departure from the Country of the</hi> Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes.</note> 
                  <hi>May,</hi> and paſſed by a little Iſland, very pleaſant, near to the Coaſt of the <hi>Caribes,</hi> holding our Courſe to go to the Iſle of <hi>Santea-Lucia,</hi> but we <note place="margin">Santa-Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</note> were deceived by the Currents which come from the South-Eaſt, having made (according to the Eſtimation of our Pilot) in one night, above ſeventy Leagues, without ſcarce any Wind. We went to touch at the Iſle of <hi>Tabuco,</hi> which remained Northwards of us. <note place="margin">Tabaco <hi>Iſle.</hi>
                  </note> Then, leaving the Iſle <hi>de-la-Trinadad</hi> towards the South, we diſcovered <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſle</hi> de la Trinadad</note>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61482:112"/>
the Teſtigues of the Iſle <hi>Blanche,</hi> which <note place="margin">Blanche-Iſle.</note> are 5 or 6 Peninſula's, very near to one another, and paſſed through the middle of them, then ſeeing Land of ſome places above: We were a long time conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring if it was Land, or thick Clouds, becauſe it was very low; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſeveral Wagers were laid, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was Land or not: At laſt, bearing directly towards it, we found out that it was really Land, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, ſince deceived by the Currents.</p>
               <p>As we approached it, we ſaw Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, running in great Companies <note place="margin">Wild-Goats.</note> along the Coaſt: Some of us not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they were, ſaid at firſt they were Bands or Cavalliers; but theſe Cavalliers proved to be Wild-Goats, of which this Iſle is full: Taking down then our Sails very low we went as near to this Iſland as we could, our Patache going continually before to diſcover if there were any Rocks, as indeed we had gone directly upon one had not the Patache given us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof with a ſignal at the end of a Pike, and took the way that ſhe ſhewed us, leaving this Rock about
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61482:113"/>
a little Stones caſt off us: It was not covered with above a Foot or two of Water, ſo that we going ſo ſwift with a light Gale of Wind, had without doubt ſplit, and been all loſt in ſuch a place without help or ſuccour; and beſides, it being in the night; but God by his mercy preſerved us there from; and being there was not much clear Water to be ſeen, we could not find the bottom to Anchor, but at laſt we found but 30 Fathoms of Water, where we caſt Anchor for this night.</p>
               <p>The next morning the 29th of <hi>May</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Voyage into the Iſle.</note> we cauſed our Boat to be Equipped to go on Shore, and to ſeek ſome Water: Our Men after Breakfaſt, went thus away, with their Muskets and Pikes, without the leaſt drop of Water along with them; but they payed dear for it: For after having gone a good way up into this Iſland, with the heat of the Sun and running after the Goats, they were ſo wonderful dry and thirſty that, they thought, they ſhould all have Died for want of a little Water; and returning again with great Trouble and Fatigue, they were forced to carry the weakeſt upon their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61482:113"/>
They brought along with them a great many Pelicans, and coming confuſedly one after another very weak and diſcomforted, and not minding any thing but Drinking; and then our General's Brother of Friendſhip coming on board our Ship, ſaid aloud, that they looked for Pearls, but he had rather have a Barrel of Water, than of Pearls, for the great Thirſt that he had endured with the reſt.</p>
               <p>The next morning we went (ſixteen <note place="margin">The Author viſites the Iſle.</note> Men) to diſcover the other ſide of the Iſland, and if there was any Water; and coming on Land we ſaw before us a great number of Wild-goats, who came running along the Sea ſide, and began to enter into a Valley, where we with Harquebuſs and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket killed five or ſix upon the place. Theſe Creatures, not being uſed to be Hunted after this manner, made a horrible noiſe and bellowing; and though they were Shot quit through the Body, yet they did not fall for that, but fled away with a light pace. We left there a Man to order theſe we had killed. I never thought then to look for the Beſoart-Stone, which theſe <note place="margin">Beſoart-Stone.</note>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61482:114"/>
Beaſts carry in their Ventricle, but to follow the others about this Iſle to find out Water, and ſome curious Things.</p>
               <p>We went thus three or four Leagues without finding any Water, at which our Companions were mightily aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and deceived as well as thoſe the day before: For we had nothing at all to quench our Thirſt, amidſt ſuch exceſſive heat of the Sun: As for me, I had carried in my Pocket a Coco's or Palm-Nut, full of Liquor, which was no ſmall help to me at this time, and I believe without that, I ſhould had much ado to have returned. Our Carpenter was forced to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, earneſtly deſiring me to tarry with him; But it was not my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lie in theſe Deſarts; beſides, the Ship was to ſet Sail the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which gave me the more courage to return the ſame day. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus rambled about, and run from one ſide to the other, at laſt we came under a great Tree, where we ſat down in the Shade to take our reſt. And as it is certain that there is no better Remedy to quench the Thirſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61482:114"/>
than Sleeping, all our Men who were a little harraſſed and fatigued, as much with Thirſt, as by the way, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving run after the <note n="*" place="margin">A ſort of Spaniſh Kid.</note> 
                  <hi>Cabrettes,</hi> fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a Sleep: But I not being at all ſleepy, laid down upon my Back, with my Face upwards to ſuck in the Air; and upon this I eſpied a great Lizard, full and very high, the Tail very long, and about the bigneſs of a Cat; I <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hunting of the</hi> Lizards</note> preſently roſe up without awakening our Men, and having taken a Pike, I gave the branch of the Tree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſuch a blow, that there tumbled down two of them, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians call <hi>Gouyana's.</hi> I run after them <note place="margin">Guyana's <hi>or</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.</note> trailing along my Pike, which broke in two pieces, and made ſuch haſte that I overtook one which was creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a Rock, and I took it by the Tail, plucking it with all my force; but it being very ſtrong, ſtretched it ſelf in ſuch a manner againſt me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very long Paws, that it ſaved its Body, but the Tail remained in my Hands, and was alive above three hours after, continually moving. As ſoon as our Men were awake, I gave them an account of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61482:115"/>
and made ſo many Courſes about this Iſland, that I caught two of theſe Lizards, whereof I made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good chear, for the Fleſh thereof is pretty good; I kept their Skins to carry away with me. This Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of a very hard Life, for after having taken, and leaving them for Dead, yet they from time to time come to move and ſtart up, ſo that carrying them in a Napkin, I thought to let them fall every moment. After we had repoſed our ſelves a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Tree, we took our way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other ſide of the Sea, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little beaten Path which went towards theſe <hi>Cabrettes,</hi> thinking that it was the way, where they went to look for Water to Drink; but after having gone about a League of this way, we found in a flat ground, a great place where theſe <hi>Cabrettes</hi> came to take their reſt, for the place was mightily beaten. We ſaw there another Path which went from this place; and hoping that it would lead us to ſome Water, we found it brought us to the Sea-ſide, where we ſaw ſome Sea-Water upon a Rock, which was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61482:115"/>
high and flat; it made us glad, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it had been freſh, but taſting of it we found the contrary, and that it was nothing but the Waves of the Sea which broke againſt this Rock, where there always remains ſome little of it, beſides the Sun had Congeled it into Salt exceeding clear and pure. Seeing then that we found no Water, it behoved us (tho' with great regret) to take again the way to our Ship, each one ſeeking the neareſt he could, for we went confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, ſtriving who might arrive firſt to quench his Thirſt; but the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we had was not ſufficient, not being more than a little Cupfull of Drink, which was ſower Citter, with two parts Water, but ſome had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Liquor for themſelves.</p>
               <p>I arrived the third at the Ship, and Bathed my Body in the Sea to refreſh my ſelf, ſopping alſo a little Bisket in the Sea to Eat, and ſwallowing ſome Mouth-fulls thereof. The reſt of our Men were tarried behind, and being come there with the Fleming and Scotchman, we called the Boat<hi>:</hi> But the Ship being above a League and a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61482:116"/>
half from Land, which was a great hinderance to us; for the Boat would not carry us back without the others, who were ſtill far enough off, and kept one another up by the Arms; But at laſt I perſuaded the Mariners to carry me on Board, where, as ſoon as I came, I went to viſit my Cheſt and my Bottle, and remained full three days without being able to quench my Thirſt: The reſt of our Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned very late, and were wonderful weary and fatigued; But the poor Carpenter tarried behind to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Cabrettes, Lizards, and Parrots, who were there in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and very beautiful. Our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſeeing that he was wanting, ſaid, he would not part from the Road un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had News of him; and ſent Seamen all the Night, with the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet <note place="margin">Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter.</note> to Sound all about the Iſland to call him, but all to no purpoſe, for he was far enough from thence. The morning being come, his Seamen was commanded to take a Shovel, with other Mariners who knew pretty nigh the place where they had left him, and went thus ſeeking about theſe Deſarts,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61482:116"/>
(for it is a flat Iſland having very few Trees:) At laſt they found him trail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along his Musket as well as he could; for he was very Sick, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the Ship, he was taken with a Fever, accompanied with a Frenzie, continuing 3 or 4 days, and did nothing but cry out for Drink, and it was almoſt impoſſible to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him: He told us afterwards how he had lain under a Tree quite full of Parrots, which he could eaſily take with his Hand; and that the <hi>Cabrettes</hi> came to ſmell upon him in the night time; but that he never ſtirred from his Musket which he always kept cloſe by him: The moiſture of the night had a little quenched his Thirſt; He was alſo forced to Drink his own Water.</p>
               <p>Being parted from this Iſle the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> to go to the <hi>Margueritta,</hi> as we were under Sail very late at night, we deſcry'd two Ships coming full ſail upon us. We had ſunk our Patache in this Deſart Iſland. We got the Wind a little upon them, and being very near one to the other, their Trumpets began to Sound, and ours
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61482:117"/>
to anſwer them. As we were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to receive them, having put out our Cannons, and ready to come to handy Strokes, the Wind being very ſavourable for us, and the night very dark, they would not come on board without having firſt known who we were. We got the Wind of them as much as we could, and in the end, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the dark and ſtormy night, we eſcaped, and made towards the Iſle of <hi>Margueritta,</hi> where we arrived the next day towards the Evening, and caſt <note place="margin">Margue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Iſland.</hi>

We found a Cannoe, which came from Fiſhing of Pearls, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing in it but Shells. The Maſter's Mate was ſent to a riſing Ground in the Iſland, to ſee if he could diſcover any thing: He eſpied 3 or 4 Blacks, who run away into the *Thorn-Buſhes as ſoon as they ſaw him, and it was impoſſible to find <note place="margin">

               <p>The third of <hi>June</hi> in the night time we had ſo violent a Tempeſt, that our Ship was in danger to have run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, but leaving an Anchor in the Sea to ſave the Ship, we were preſerved from this imminent danger.</p>
               <p>The fourth day of the ſame month, ſeeing we could not find any ſweet Water, we weighed our Anchors and bore towards <hi>Cumana,</hi> and arriving 2 or 3 Leagues on this ſide, we perceiv'd <note place="margin">Cumana.</note> a Fleming Ship in a Bay or Gulf, lading with Bay-Salt, which is there in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance<hi>:</hi> We caſt Anchor on the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board-ſide of her, and put out our Boat into the Sea to Board them, and ſo to ask them where we might find ſome freſh Water.

               <p>THE Voyage that I had made the former year to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> had left me ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee alſo the reſt of the World, that I was reſolved to go to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> if I found any fit opportunity: For this effect, I parted from <hi>Paris</hi> the 12th of <hi>April</hi> 1605. and taking
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61482:126"/>
my way ſtraight to <hi>Britagne,</hi> I went to Embark at <hi>St. Lezer, (St. Nazare)</hi> in a Ship of <hi>Poligain,</hi> where we were not above twenty Perſons in all.</p>
               <p>We were at the beginning of this Voyage ſo beaten with contrary Winds, that we were forced to the Coaſt of <hi>Galice,</hi> a little below Cape <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Vere.</hi> Having continued there for ſome time, we ſet ſail with the Wind, and arrived at <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> at ſuch time as they were Rejoycing for the Birth of an Infant of <hi>Spain;</hi> which was a very fine ſight. For after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rejoycing at</hi> Lisbon.</note> a long time run the Bulls, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their manner of Paſtime, where there was a great many Horſes maimed, and Cavalliers overturned <note place="margin">Lamed.</note> to the Ground, they laded a Bull with Crackers, but there was ſuch a great number of them on him, that he fell down under the Burthen; and they were forced to fetch a ſtrong Ox to carry them, and yet he ſtoop'd under ſo heavy a Load: Theſe Crackers were faſtened one to another, ſo that they covered all the Body of this Ox; then there was others tied to his Horns. When the Feaſt was ended, fire was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61482:126"/>
put to theſe Crackers, and then you would have ſaid, that the Ox flew in the Air, with ſuch an Impetuoſity, which looked like Lightning; for Ten Thouſand Muskets would not have made ſo great a noiſe, each Cracker anſwering one another, ſo that the Ox remained quite roaſted.</p>
               <p>I made ſome ſtay at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> upon the hopes that I ſhould, (as I have ſaid) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dutch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my towards</hi> Lisbon.</note> find paſſage to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> if the Fleet had gone there that year: But as it was ready to part, the Dutch Fleet came to caſt Anchor about the Bar of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where they ſtayed a long time, waiting for the ſaid Fleet; but the Portugueſe were not ſo fooliſh as to venture out. After that, Don <hi>Louis Fajardo,</hi> General of the Army, knowing that the Hollanders were now retired, riged out a Fleet of 35 ſail to follow after; and went a good way out into the Sea, ſending a little Ship before, called the <hi>Pearl,</hi> (taken from the <hi>Rochellers)</hi> to diſcover'em; But this Veſſel meeting with the Hollanders, was taken by them, and all the reſt returned to the Haven of <hi>Lisbon</hi> without doing any thing.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61482:127"/>
Having then loſt this occaſion of paſſing to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> at that time, I was reſolved to go to <hi>Barbary,</hi> and for this Cauſe Embarked at <hi>Caſcais,</hi> in a Veſſel belonging to Captain <hi>Poul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>We bore South Eaſt, and paſſed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Voyage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> along by <hi>Azamor,</hi> near to the City of <hi>Lions,</hi> which is a place ruined, having ſtill very high Towers. On Wedneſday the 8th day of the month, we caſt Anchor in the Road of <hi>Saffy,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Saffy.</note> where I tarried ſome time without going on Shore at all: But <hi>Cidi-Hamet Talbe,</hi> or Secretary to the King of <hi>Morocco, Mulei-Boufairs</hi> being come to <hi>Saffy</hi> with his <hi>Almahalle,</hi> or <note place="margin">Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halle.</note> little Army, to conduct the Caravan which was come to <hi>Morocco,</hi> and to reconduct the other, which was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, he ſell Sick; and having heard that there was a <hi>Tabibe,</hi> or a Phyſitian on board our Ship, he ſent ſome Moors immediately to fetch me. I went with them on Land, not knowing what they would do with me; and coming there upon the Port, I found this <hi>Cidi-Hamet</hi> ſitting with a great number of Moors along the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61482:127"/>
Walls of the Caſtle; and as ſoon as he ſaw me, he roſe up, and taking me by the Hand, led me into his Camp, which was without <hi>Saffy,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Tent, being very fine, and curiouſly Embroidered with Figures, after the Moreſque. There I found a Jew, which ſerved for Interpreter in the <hi>Gemique,</hi> (which is Spaniſh or corrupted Portugueſe) which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and having diſcourſed with me about his Diſeaſe, I reſolved upon that which I thought beſt for his Cure; and for this cauſe went on board our Ship to look for Drugs fit for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I Purged him ſo, that I cauſed him to Vomit up Worms like little Serpents; which made me not a little admire, for they were ſo very great, and long, that it was almoſt impoſſible to imagine that ſuch odious and horrible things could be in Human Bodies: Since that, he was very well and was my great Friend; and he and his <hi>Alcades</hi> ſhewed me all the kindneſs imaginable: He gave me a Horſe to go to <hi>Morocco,</hi> making very much of me by the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:61482:128"/>
Thus we parted from <hi>Saffy</hi> to go to <hi>Morocco,</hi> the 28th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and went to pitch the <hi>Almahalle</hi> near to the <hi>Adouars</hi> or Tents of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> and went to ſee them with ſome Moors their Enemies. Theſe <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> cauſed us to enter into their Tents; then they put ſome Carpets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very thick and hairy upon the Ground for us to ſit upon, and brought us ſome Camels Milk to Drink, with I don't know what other things: After that, we retired in the night to the Camp of the Moors, which was not very far from thence.</p>
               <p>The next morning we raiſed our Tents, and went to pitch the <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halle</hi> at the <hi>Duguele,</hi> were there is Water. The <hi>Arabians</hi> had made there a great many large and deep Ditches, which they call <hi>Matamores,</hi> in ſuch manner that it is a very dreadful thing to look to the bottom of them: 'Tis there they find Water; in ſome of which there is ſome, in others none: And theſe <hi>Arabs</hi> come to look there for VVater, above 4 or 5 Leagues round about. From the <hi>Puquelle</hi> they come with their Camels, which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61482:128"/>
they lade with this VVater, in <hi>Oudres,</hi> or Goat Skins. And when they have Reaped their Corn, they raiſe their <hi>Adouars,</hi> or Tents, and go away to ſome other place far diſtant from thence, leaving this Ground to lie waſte a long time<hi>:</hi> Then afterwards, they return there again, laying their Houſes and Husbandry, VVives and <note place="margin">Arabians, <hi>and their manner of Living.</hi>
                  </note> Children, upon their Camels, like as the antient <hi>Nomades,</hi> and the <hi>Tartar Hordes,</hi> at this day, and go altogether in a Company, by <hi>Cabilles</hi> or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; ſo that if any one comes to ſtrike one of their Generation, they think themſelves all thereby injured, and preſently Revenge it. There are ſome of theſe <hi>Cabilles</hi> who joyn themſelves together to make VVar upon other <hi>Cabilles</hi> that are not their Friends: There are ſometimes above Twelve thouſand of a <hi>Cabille</hi> or Parentage: For they Marry one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Couſins, and thus conſerve the Memory of themſelves. The moſt Ancient, and VViſeſt amongſt them, they make Chief, and Obey him in all Things, and every where, as their own Father, with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61482:129"/>
Reſpect, as I have ſeen in their <hi>Alcayde-Abdaſſis,</hi> Captain of one of theſe <hi>Cabilles,</hi> which conducted us from <hi>Morocco</hi> to <hi>Saffy,</hi> to hinder thoſe of his <hi>Cabille</hi> from doing us any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, for he had taken us in his Cuſtody upon his Head, having ſo promiſed it to the King of <hi>Morocco;</hi> foraſmuch as his People held a good part of the way betwixt <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Saffy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to our Voyage; the morning being come, we raiſed the Tents, and in waiting till the Camels were Laded, the <hi>Cavaliers, Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> exerciſed themſelves at the Lance: And there was, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a young <hi>Alcayde,</hi> who took his Courſe with his Lance againſt me, crying out to me in his Language, <note place="margin">Senari <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bara, bara, aben ſenari,</hi> which is to ſay, Guard thy ſelf, thou Son of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſpurr'd then my Horſe, which was a <hi>Barbe,</hi> very nimble, having two Piſtols at my Saddle-bow, I ran at the Re-incountre with this <hi>Cavalier;</hi> but my Horſe being ſtrong in the Mouth, was very near Precipitating me to the bottom of theſe <hi>Matamores,</hi> or Pits of <note place="margin">Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores.</note>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61482:129"/>
Water, which I have ſpoken of; for the Mouth of them are hid amongſt the Graſs, and they are there in great numbers: But ſeeing my ſelf almoſt upon the brink, and my Horſe going to leap to the other ſide (which he could never have done without looſing us both:) I reined him ſo to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that if the <hi>Alcayde,</hi> which exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with me, had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not alſo ſtopped, ſeeing me ſo near this Precipice, I had infallibly tumbled therein, but never come out again entirely; conſidering their great and horrible Depth.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw my ſelf delivered from this danger, I praiſed God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired as far as I could from thence, leaving theſe <hi>Moors</hi> to exerciſe by themſelves, not knowing ſo well as they, where theſe <hi>Matamores</hi> are, ſo dangerous to thoſe who are not aware of them.</p>
               <p>After that we Travelled all the reſt of this Day, and endured extream Heats until toward Evening, then we pitched our Tents along by ſome Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where all theſe <hi>Arabs</hi> caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to waſh, and refreſh 'em, at which I was not a little vexed, for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61482:130"/>
I had a great mind to drink of this Water, all muddy and dirty as it was, and beſides a little faltiſh, yet I was forced to Drink thereof. We pitched then in theſe Deſarts, and the next <note place="margin">Deſarts without Waters.</note> day, early in the Morning we depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Travelling all the Day in the Heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the greateſt that can be poſſibly imagined, in theſe Fields Scorched and Burnt, becauſe of the Hot Winds which blew after ſuch a manner, that we were ready to Die with Thirſt<hi>:</hi> At laſt, we came into a Deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt, where we were forced to look for Water a far off. There was there the <hi>Adouars</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who <note place="margin">Adouars.</note> helped us to ſome Refreſhments of water and Camels Milk, which is not very ſweet, but of a ſtrange taſt to thoſe who are not accuſtomed to it; but neceſſity makes every thing to ſeem Good, as I have often experienced in all my Voyages.</p>
               <p>The next morning going on our way, we perceived ſeveral <hi>Arabs</hi> with their Camels laden with Corn, who came to joyn with us, to go to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:61482:130"/>
We met alſo great Numbers of <hi>Arabians</hi> on Horſe-back with their Launces, who came about us to ſalute their chief <hi>Abdaſſis,</hi> and others of their kindred who were in our Company; I ſaw them come with great Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to kiſs the Hands of their General <hi>Abdaſſis</hi> who had Govern'd them a long time.</p>
               <p>I went always in their Company, leaving the other Troops behind, for the deſire I had, by following them, to get ſome Water of the <hi>Arabs</hi> their Friends, whom we found encamped in a Valley of the Deſarts; for we went continually with ſo exceſſive a Heat, that I durſt not ſo much as lift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up my Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Going thus, we met at the bottom of a Mountain ſome <hi>Arabian</hi> Shepherds, who kept Flocks of Sheep, Goats, and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els: We went with a number of Cavalliers towards them, to know where we might find ſome Water, but they would not ſhew us: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one of theſe <hi>Arabs,</hi> who came a long with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commanded one of theſe Shephards to give him his Stick; and having it in his Hands, began to

beat theſe poor Wretches with ſuch <note place="margin">Water <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> fury, that I was very ſorry to ſee it, although I was alſo very Thirſty. This Savage Treatment made the Shepherds ſhew us where their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douars</hi> were, about a League from thence; where we went with all diligence, and found there one of theſe <hi>Arabs,</hi> who came to fetch Water far from thence, in a Goat-Skin. This Water was very Salt and hot; yet every one of theſe Cavalliers caſt themſelves thereupon, for it was very little for ſo many Men. I obliged them ſo, with Money, that I obtained ſome of one of theſe <hi>Arabs</hi> where we were come. Truly it ſeemed, that they bereaved theſe poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wretches of their Lives in taking away their Water they come to look for ſo far, and beſides there is but little to be found, the Weather being ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive hot; for all their <hi>Matamores</hi> were dried up at that time.</p>
               <p>Having a little refreſhed our ſelves, we went to rejoyn the Camp of the <hi>Almahalle,</hi> and pitched our Tents near the River <hi>Tenſif,</hi> a little days Journey from <hi>Morocco.</hi> We met a great <note place="margin">Tenſif <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

many <hi>Arabians</hi> all on Horſeback, with their Launces, who came about us, to Salute their General <hi>Abdaſſis,</hi> and others of their Friends, who were in our Company.</p>
               <p>I ſaw them again come with great Humility to Kiſs the Hands of this their Chief, <hi>Abdaſſis,</hi> as before. There we quenched our Thirſt a little with this Water; though it was very hot. All the Land in theſe Countries is various, ſome part good, and others bad, but for the moſt part Inculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, except that which is near ſome Water, which they Till. This River <hi>Tenſif</hi> Breeds the moſt excellent Trouts of any in the World, being very little, and their Fleſh red, but of an excellent Taſte, and are mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed at <hi>Morocco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning, going a little <note place="margin">Morocco.</note> further, we diſcovered <hi>Morocco,</hi> in a great Campagne; and this City ſeems to be ſituated near to Mount <note place="margin">Atlas <hi>Mountain.</hi>

                  <hi>Atlas,</hi> though it is above 7 Leagues diſtant: VVe found by the way ſome Chriſtians, who came about us.</p>

                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:61482:132"/>
Theſe are People that Traffick there, and when they hear that any other Chriſtians come with the <hi>Caſile,</hi> they are very glad, and meet them by the way: They bring with them a little Mule laden with Victuals. Now the moſt part of the Chriſtians of this <hi>Caſile</hi> were Engliſh, Priſoners, with Irons upon their Feet, and had been <note place="margin">

them to ſave himſelf in their Veſſel wherein they were to Embark. For this cauſe, he went to Pitch his <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halle</hi> towards the place where they come to take Water for the Ships, near to the Cape of <hi>Cantin;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

As ſoon as they heard this, preſently the People of Boat (who were hid in the Buſhes) came to ſeize upon his Perſon, and took him, and carried him away in their Veſſel, by which means he ſaved himſelf. The Slave fled to the <hi>Almahalle,</hi> to give them notice of the taking of his Maſter, at which they were mightily aſtoniſhed, and preſently retired to <hi>Saffy:</hi> But as the People of an Engliſh Boat at the ſame time were come on Shore for ſome things they had then occaſion for, they were Arreſted, and had Irons

clapt upon their Feet, as I ſaw them in the Caſtle of <hi>Saffy,</hi> in very poor Equipage, and were ſince carried to <hi>Morocco,</hi> where the Merchants paid for them, I don't know how many Ounces of Gold, which was very near the Ranſom of the <hi>Alcayde Abdalacinthe</hi> who had eſcap'd: For thoſe Kings will not looſe any thing, it being the Cuſtom at <hi>Marocco,</hi> that when a Slave runs away, all the others aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together and pay for him, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning one another to go freely about <note place="margin">

               <p>To return to the Chriſtians of <hi>Morocco,</hi> who met us by the way, they made us very good chear, in a Garden, along by a pleaſant Water running ſome two Leagues from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco.</hi> The <hi>Almahalle</hi> entered not into <note place="margin">

The Sieur <hi>Hubert</hi> lived about a year at <hi>Morocco,</hi> practiſing Phyſick near the King, and there following his principal deſign, that is, the Learning the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue; ſo that ſince he rendered himſelf very expert therein, as he hath made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profeſſion thereof at <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, with great Solemnity<hi>:</hi> He contented himſelf to depart out of this Country more laden with Science and <hi>Arabick</hi> Books, than with Riches, or any Commodities, in which the Sieur <hi>de l'Iſle</hi> was more happy than he.</p>

Being then in the <hi>Juderie,</hi> I was there conducted by a Jew, who Cozened me of ſome Rials, giving me falſly to underſtand, that I was to pay ſome at the Door of this place, where we were to enter; and indeed he brought one, who came to demand it, and I was forced to Content them.</p>

After that, he ſent ſome of the <hi>Alcaydes</hi> his great Favourites to go fetch his Wives and his Daughter, who brought along with them all his Treaſure, but they were Robb'd before day, near to <hi>Angoumet,</hi> in a place where they had ſat down to take a little reſt from the fatigue of the way.

The <hi>Alcaydes</hi> or Conductors of theſe Women, ſeeing themſelves thus Rob'd, and without any means to recover their loſs, did enter themſelves into an <hi>Aſoy</hi> or Moſque to the <hi>Alforme,</hi> or Sanctuary, of a Saint <hi>Marabou.</hi> But <hi>Muley-Abdalla</hi> hearing of it, ſent to fetch them out, with the <hi>Marabou</hi> alſo, who earneſtly deſired <hi>Abdalla</hi> to give them their Lives, which he promiſed to do; But before they arrived at his <hi>Micouart,</hi> or Palace, he commanded all their Heads to be chopped off; <note place="margin">African <hi>Faith.</hi>

               <p>Now, as I paſſed one day about the <hi>Alcaſaue,</hi> which is the King's Houſe, I ſaw a Cannon caſt of a wonderful bigneſs; and being ſurpriſed at the greatneſs of the ſize, I was told that it had been made for a certain <hi>Alcayde,</hi>

teaching her ſecretly her Belief, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that this Damſel engrafted ſo well the Law of the True God in her Heart, that it was impoſſible for her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Teachers to make her learn any more of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and kept her ſelf conſtant in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Slave, without going any more to the Moſque. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed thereof, ſent for this New Convert to come before him, and Threatning her, that if ſhe would not renounce the Law of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he would put her to Death, She generouſly anſwered, that ſhe did not fear Death; and that all the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World ſhould not make her quit the Belief ſhe had acquir'd. The King ſeeing this, commanded her to be put into the Hands of the <hi>Haquin,</hi> or great Judge, to be put to Death: But ſhe being reſolved not to make any ſhew that ſhe feared Death, and about to be executed, the King asked her again if ſhe would not be Converted to their Law again: But, ſhe anſwered, that their Law ſignified nothing in reference to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and that ſhe would Die for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61482:139"/>
the Love of him who had ſuffered Death for us. When this barbarous King ſaw that all theſe Prayers and Remonſtrances were in vain, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured once more to divert her from this Reſolution, promiſing to Marry her to one of his higheſt Court Favourites; But ſhe mocked the more at all his Promiſes; at which, the King being enraged, commanded her to be Beheaded, which was done accordingly. And thus Chriſtianly, and conſtantly, this innocent and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Damſel ſuffered Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>Now as I curiouſly viſited this City of <hi>Morocco,</hi> I entered one day into <note place="margin">Kings-Palace.</note> the <hi>Micouart,</hi> or Palace of the King, and ſaw in the firſt Court extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fine Buildings <hi>A-la-Moreſque,</hi> with Fountains, and a great many Orange and Lemon-Trees, laden with Fruit; But at the ſecond Court, where I alſo entered, were little Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries ſuſtained with Pillars of White Marble, ſo well cut, and contrived, that the beſt Workmen would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Workman-ſhip thereof; and upon the Ground were a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Veſſels of Marble, full of clear

and freſh Water, where I ſaw the Moors waſh themſelves before their going to Rehearſe their <hi>Sala</hi> or Prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as ſoon as they eſpied me, they began to cry out, and run after me, which made me mend my pace in good earneſt to get preſently from thence. I ſaw in another Garden, a very fine Fiſh Pond of Stone Work, where the Moors Bath themſelves, and found there ſome Mooriſh Women who were waſhing their <hi>

               <p>After this I went to ſee the Lions, <note place="margin">Lions.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61482:140"/>
as knowing his Strength, began to ſcratch him gently with his Teeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Scab which the Lion had upon his Throat; at which, the Lion took ſuch pleaſure, that he not only ſuffered the Dog patiently ſo to do, but alſo defended him from the others: So that when I ſaw him, he had been then ſeven years with theſe Lions, as the Chriſtian Slave told me who look'd after them; and told me alſo, that when they gave the Lions any thing to Eat, the Dog fed with them, and would ſometimes ſnatch the Meat from their very Chops; And when the Lions would fight together for their Food, the Dog did all he could to part them and when he ſaw he could not do it, by a Natural Inſtinct he began to howl after ſuch a manner, that the Lions (who fear the cry of Dogs)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſently would part them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and agree together.</p>
               <p>This example of Animals ſhews that we ought to be humble and obedient towards thoſe who are greater than our ſelves, and how noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the Lion is amongſt other Beaſts.</p>

At my going from theſe Lions, I went to ſee the Kings Horſes, who <note place="margin">Horſes.</note> were in Stalls after their manner, and were fat, and extraordinary well Dreſs'd and clean Skin'd. They are Chriſtian Slaves who look after them, and have a great, and leſſer Stable alſo, well ordered that it is impoſſible for any to be better: They are all Barb-Horſes, the fineſt in the World. After having walked enough about the City for this time, I returned back to the <hi>Douane,</hi> which is the place where the Chriſtians are oblig'd to retire themſelves, a good League from the <hi>Alcaſave,</hi> or Palace Royal, which is near the <hi>Juderie.</hi>
               </p>

Now as this Prince of <hi>Morocco</hi> was in this perplexity in his Tent, it happened that two of his Soldiers were playing at Cheſs in their Tent, and one of them found himſelf ſo much engaged, that he could not make his King go either backward or forward, he being under Check; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which his Companion, Laughing, ſaid, he was like their Prince, who could neither advance nor retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing himſelf to great danger: As he was ſaying theſe Words, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that one of the Prince's Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,

paſſing by chance near this Tent, overheard them, and went preſently away to give his Maſter an account of this Diſcourſe, who, hearing it, ſent at that inſtant to fetch theſe two Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers before him, who were mightily aſtoniſhed; and having enquired ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things of them, and particularly of that which they had done and ſaid; At laſt, ſeeing themſelves urged, they confeſſed the truth, and proſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves upon the Ground, they begged his Pardon, which the Prince did eaſily conſent to, and demanded of him, who had ſaid thus, what he would adviſe him to do in ſuch an extremity: The Soldier wiſely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that if he would take his Advice, he ſhould not only ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Men, but ſhould alſo come of with great Honour, if the thing which he had contrived in his Mind took effect. The Prince Commanded him to ſay boldly what he would; upon which the Soldier proceeded, and ſaid, that the King of <hi>Gago</hi> had a Beautiful Daughter to Marry, and that he, who was a young Prince, and wanted a Wife, ſhould ſend Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors

and I believe that at laſt they recovered their own.

               <p>The 23th of the ſame month we went to pitch the <hi>Almahalle</hi> cloſe by Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> in a level ground, in which place I went to look for ſome Plants and Herbs, and as I returned again into the Camp, the <hi>Alcayde Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſis,</hi> Captain of a Cabille of <hi>Arabians,</hi> perceived me, and called me to him, asking me what Herbs theſe were that I carried, and what I intended to do with them; after I had ſatisfied his Demands, I withdrew into our Tent: About 4 or 5 a clock in the evening, going out to walk and to take the freſh Air, I met again with the <hi>Alcayde,</hi> who was alſo walking about to viſit his Camp; and having called me, took me by the Hand, and led me without the Camp, giving me account of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things of the Wars of <hi>Africa,</hi> and <note place="margin">

we parted from <hi>Morocco;</hi> and that all his delight was in <hi>Comer, Couſcouſſou, Auquam;</hi> that is, eating of a certain Confection made up into Sugar-Plums; but he found himſelf deceived; for he loſt the Battle, as I have ſaid already, and was Depoſed from his Kingdom, and fled away to Mount <hi>Atlas</hi> about the month of <hi>November</hi> 1606. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as our <hi>Noſter-Damus</hi> had predicted in his Centuries, as I have been ſhewed ſince: <hi>Abdaſſis</hi> told me alſo thereupon, that the Soldiers are mightily diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged when the King comes not to <note place="margin">Good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for Kings.</note> Battle in Perſon; And when he is Couragious, or a Coward, his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers become the ſame.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Couſcouſſou</hi> of which I have made mention, and which I have Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <note place="margin">Coucouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſou.</note> ſeveral times, it is Meal made up and Kneaded into the faſhion of Sugar-Plums or Comfits, with Water, in a Frying-pan; then put it in an Earthen Veſſel full of holes at the bottom, like a Cullender, after that, it is put in a Pot upon a hot Fire, and the Vapour boils it; then they pour Broth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and eat it by great bits like Balls: It is of a very good Taſte, which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes

               <p>After this Diſcourſe of the <hi>Alcayde,</hi> we withdrew our ſelves into our Tents until the next morning that we began again to take Journey, and had that day very bad way by ſteep and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible Mountains, not being able to keep any Order for the inſupportable Heat; as for freſh Water we had none. I was mounted upon a Mule, and was forced frequently to get down to beat it away on foot, which was no ſmall trouble for me, in that I had near 6000 Crowns about me, as well in Lignots, as in Tybre, that is Powder, as it comes from <hi>Gago,</hi> and alſo in Money, which are Sequins of the Country: I had a great deal of trouble to remount; for it did not behove me to ſtay behind, for fear of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> and of thoſe of our Caravan themſelves.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed all the hardſhips of this Journey, we came to pitch at the

I was upon my Mule, and coming near to an old Well, they got down, bidding me alſo to do the like: I thought there had been there ſome Fountain to refreſh our ſelves; but ſeeing that they had a mind to make me get down only to entice me into this Well, I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">

I gathered a great many of them, which I laid up, and having cauſed Biſcuit to be made for my Voyage, with other Refreſhments, we ſet ſail the 24th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1607. and having contrary Winds <note place="margin">

               <p>Being entered into the Channel, we deſcried a Ship, making full ſail upon us, and believing that it was a Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we prepared our ſelves to receive her, but the night coming on, which was very Stormy, we loſt her, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more to the N.E.

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61482:152"/>
In the end, ſeeing the Ship like to be caſt away, they reſolved to Board her, and entering, they found nothing but this Cat, at which they were mightily aſtoniſhed, and took the Ship into Port; It was laden with Corn, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard that the People were loſt near the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> they left it in the hands of the Juſtice, until it might be reſtored to the right Owners.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61482:161"/>
and encouraged us to come nearer to this ſo dangerous and tempeſtuous <note place="margin">Furious Tempeſt.</note> place: For coming there, we had the moſt furious and greateſt Storm that I ever ſaw; Our Carrack was about 2000 Tun, one of the Gallanteſt Ships in all <hi>Portugal,</hi> having been built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 30 years, and yet ſeemed to be but like a ſimple Boat, amongſt theſe high and dreadful Waves. We needed little Fore-Maſt to the Wind, and 30 or 40 Mariners at the Stern. In this Stormy Weather we could not keep our Ship with Wind, and were about a 100 Perſons, 50 on each ſide, to Deviſe how to get again before the Wind, which we had loſt. Our Deck was covered all over with Water, and it was impoſſible to get any farther than the Planks of the Ship, either behind or before.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61482:161"/>
But God of his Goodneſs heard our Prayers, appeaſing by little and little this great Tempeſt, which we had ſo long endured; ſo that having paſſed this dangerous place, we deſcried the Cape of <hi>Aigu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and from thence we arrived at the Land of <hi>Natall,</hi> where it was very <note place="margin">Natall.</note> tempeſtuous, and almoſt as dark as night: We found there boiſterous Winds, and we were forced to labour day and night to avoid the <hi>Baixos ds los Judios,</hi> or <hi>da Judia,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <note place="margin">Baixos de los Judias.</note> Shelves of the Jews in the Channel of the Coaſt of <hi>Sofala,</hi> where there is a great many Ships loſt, and where amongſt others, happened that no leſs lamentable than memorable Ship wrack of the Ship called the <hi>St. James,</hi> in the year 1585. who going to <hi>Goa</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> ſplit upon theſe Rocks, and of 250 Perſons, not above 90 eſcaped, by different manners, with as much or more misfortune and miſeries on Land as they had enjoy'd on the Sea: There was ſome Fathers, Jeſuits, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans caſt away there, and others ſaved themſelves. The ſtrange and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61482:162"/>
lamentable circumſtances of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, have rendered this Shipwrack the moſt remarkable that ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in theſe Seas; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that theſe Rocks are ſo much feared, which are like great heaps of ſharp Stones and ſpikes of White Coral, and commonly covered with Water, ſo that they are not perceived until you are upon them, and the Ship ſplitting; but we by the help of God eſcaped them, ſo that having taken the height, and ſeeing our ſelves eſcaped, we made the beſt of our way towards this Harbour, where we found the two Gallies as I have ſaid before, and knowing them again, we bore towards them, and caſt Anchor 4 Leagues from the Iſles, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Boat to Land to hear news from <hi>Moſambique,</hi> which is about 25 Leagues from thence. There came on board us a <hi>Pangais,</hi> who told us how <hi>Moſambique</hi> had been Beſieged by the Hollanders, and that it was not above 15 days ſince they had raiſed the Siege, and had taken the Galley of <hi>Good Jeſus,</hi> which they burnt; and <note place="margin">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61482:162"/>
for thoſe of the Gallion knew nothing of the Death of the Count <hi>de la Fera,</hi> nor of the diſperſing of the Fleet, they being ſeparated from us hard by the Iſle of <hi>Madera:</hi> We weighed Anchor from thence, not finding above 5 or 6 Fathoms Water. As the Wind began to clear it behoved us to caſt our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, and the next day to raiſe them again; this was the 15th of <hi>Sept.</hi> but the Currents of Water which run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Iſlands of <hi>Angoche,</hi> were like to have ſwallowed us up: We endured a world of Hardſhips in caſting and weighing Anchor, which left me ſome Bliſters upon my Hands; and as weak as I was, I laboured with all my might to be rid of theſe dangerous paſſages: In the end, we caſt and weighed our Anchors ſo, that we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Moſambique</hi> the 29th of <hi>Sep.</hi> and Anchored near the Iſles of <hi>St. George,</hi>

               <p>The next morning we Anchored near ths Fortreſs. As ſoon as we arrived at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> we underſtood how our Vice-Admiral had paſſed the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope</hi> immediately after us, when the Storm was a little allayed; and

how they had ſeen a Sea-Monſter paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <note place="margin">Sea Monster</note> along by the Ship, which was of a ſtrange form and wonderful great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He blowed and ſnored with a great noiſe, and kept his Body in a round like a Pillar, carrying a thing like a Shield before his Head, and a Saddle upon his Back: As he paſſed cloſe by the Ship, he made ſo terrible a noiſe, that they thought themſelves all loſt; but he left them, and they ſaw him no more.</p>
               <p>Being then arrived at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> we were mightily aſtoniſhed to find there nothing to Eat, being then ſo fallen away by the fatigue of the Sea<hi>:</hi> We went on ſhore, having Anchored the <hi>St. Bartholomew, St. Anthony, St. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and our own, which was the Admiral: They were there full five Months, waiting for the <hi>Mueſſon</hi> of VVinds to convey us to <hi>Goa.</hi> VVe endured there not a little; for as I have ſaid, we could find nothing to live upon, there not being any Bread. The Sick were put in Cabins of Palm, ſome in the Fortreſs, and others in the City; but they Died by 10 and 15 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and there remained 735 Buried, <note place="margin">Number of the Dead.</note>

as the haplain of our Ship told me, who kept a Liſt of them.</p>
               <p>I went alſo on Shore, ſcarce able to go, and walked about the Streets look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſomething to Eat; but I could find nothing ſave ſome little Fiſhes fryed, which theſe <hi>Ethiopian</hi> VVomen ſell about the Streets, with ſome Cakes of Meal Baked upon the Coals, which <note place="margin">Mocates.</note> they call <hi>Mocates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I bought ſome of this Fiſh fryed in the Oyl of <hi>Gerſelin,</hi> (a little Seed like Carraways, which they make Oil <note place="margin">Rape-Seed.</note> of) which has a very ill Taſte; Then retiring alone to make a Feaſt, and comforting my ſelf the beſt I could, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying wholly upon God: I demanded a little Water of theſe VVomen, who gave me ſome, but it was ſo Salt that I could ſcarce drink any of it; for they had drawn it out of a naſty VVell, which was hard by the place where I was; But they fetch the good VVater out of the Continent, at a place called <hi>Cabaſſie:</hi> There is indeed a little Spring, but it was little better than nothing.</p>
               <p>After that I went again on Board the Ship; Then the next day I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again to Land, to look for ſome

to lodge in, becauſe the Hollanders had burnt all the Houſes; and by chance I found a Soldier, who took me into his Lodging within the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, where I carried all my Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; But after having been there ſome days, as well to Purge my ſelf, as to be cured of my Diſeaſe, comes ſome of the Servants of Captain <hi>Mor</hi> to look for me, and commanded me to follow them to ſpeak with their Maſter: I followed them in abundance of pain, and they haſtning me forward, which I did after the beſt manner I could through theſe Sands towards the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the end, they laid me upon the Back of an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> to carry me into his <hi>Almadie,</hi> which is a ſort of a <note place="margin">Almadie.</note> little Boat of the Country, made of a hollow Tree: They caſt me within it as if I had been a Log of VVood; and one of the Serjeants Embarked with me: The Tide being come, he made the Blacks row, to bring me on board the Vice-Admiral St. <hi>Jerome:</hi> I was a long time in this <hi>Almadie,</hi> du ring the exceſſive heat of the Sun a-Noon-Day, and I expected to Die with Heat and Thirſt, and bought a

               <p>When I came on Board, he put me into the Hands of the <hi>Merigne,</hi> or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant of the Ship, who demanded of him how he would have me faſtened; to which he anſwered, by the Neck, the <hi>Merigne</hi> opened the Collars of Iron, <note place="margin">Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Author, and his Miſery.</note> and cauſed me to lie down all along, and ſhut my Neck betwixt two pieces of Wood: But ſeeing me Sick, he had ſome Compaſſion upon me and gave me a Pillow to put under my Head: <hi>I</hi> was in this miſerable Condition from the 7th to the 28th of <hi>October,</hi> at which time <hi>I</hi> was ſet at liberty.</p>

Don <hi>Louis</hi> ſeeing that he could obtain no Reſtitution of this wicked Man, he Embarked to go on his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Cumana,</hi> to the Conqueſt of the Gold, which this King, Enemy to <hi>Monomopata</hi> had; and Captain <hi>Mor</hi> thinking, that Don <hi>Louis</hi> upon his ſetting Sail would board the Ship where we were Priſoners, ſent a great number of Soldiers and Cannoniers, with charge to fire at, and ſink the <hi>Pangais</hi> of Don <hi>Louis,</hi> if he made the leaſt ſhew to Board them.

Whereupon the Captain ſent for the Maſter Cannonier, cauſing him to be Impriſoned, and Irons clapt upon his Feet, bidding him prepare himſelf to be Hanged: But this Maſter Canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier being a ſtout bold Fellow, and not at all aſtoniſhed at theſe Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, boldly told him that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf he had more offended in Commanding, than he had done in Diſobeying to Fire upon Don <hi>Louis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being thus over, the next day in the evening, the Captain ſent one of his Men to take off my Irons, who left me Priſoner below Deck, with 6 Soldiers to guard me, who followed me every where for fear that I ſhould leap into the Sea to ſave my ſelf.</p>

When I ſaw my ſelf a little more at liberty, I aſſiſted the Secretary <hi>John Baptiſto,</hi> with a little Biſcuit cut into little Bits, being black, rotten, and mouldy, and much ado to get that: I raiſed up, as well as I could, the cover of the place where I was encloſed, and thus gave him ſome little Bits, which was no ſmall help to him.</p>
               <p>But as God never forſakes his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in their Afflictions, the ſaid <hi>John Baptiſto</hi> told me in Latin, that he had found means to open the Pad-Locks of his Irons, and to take them of; and had alſo met with a Pipe of Wine, but could not get any of it without a hollow piece of Tinn, which he would uſe, putting a Stick through it with ſome Tow or Flax at the end, like a Sponge, and thus to draw out the Wine: I diſcovered this Buſineſs to the <hi>Merigne,</hi> who kept us Priſoners, and who was very well ſatisfied to have his part thereof, and not to ſay a word, getting me a Burrage of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which I gave to the ſaid <hi>Baptiſto</hi> at night, when the Soldiers were buſie at their ſports above us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lamp was lighted<hi>:</hi> This
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61482:168"/>
Wine was no ſmall help to us, and I believe that without it we could ſearce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſubſiſted any longer; for I ſopped in private a little Biſcuit in this VVine, which heartned me mightily.</p>
               <p>About 5 days after, when Don <hi>Louis d' Alves</hi> was gone, <hi>John Baptiſto</hi> was taken out from under the Hatches, and was left under the Deck with me, but not without Irons faſtned on his Feet, when, as for me, I had no longer either Collars or Irons: Now one day as I was walking backwards and forwards upon the Deck, I by good fortune found under a Cannon, a Stone Bottle full of Syrop of Gilli-flowers; this I communicated to the <hi>Meregne,</hi> who took and kept it up for us both: I made uſe of this Syrop very often, as well to drink as to ſop a little Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit therein, and in a little time I perceived my Gumbs to grow better, and my Legs began to ſtretch, which was no ſmall comfort to me; in ſhort, I was quite cured of my Diſeaſe, alſo making uſe of ſome Remedies which I took out of a Cheſt full of Medecines which I found one day below Deck quite open.</p>

Having continued about 22 days in this faſhion; the Captain came one night very late on Board, and then I took occaſion to Diſcourſe him, to know what he had a mind to do with me, and why he let me thus languiſh; He made me anſwer, that I ſhould come on Shore with him, to ſpeak with Captain <hi>Mor.</hi> The 28th of the ſame month we went to ſee Captain <hi>Mor,</hi> who demanded of me, wherefore I came, and having anſwered, that the Captain had brought me to ſpeak with him, he bid me wait till the next day, and commanded the Captain to take me to his Lodging.</p>
               <p>The next day being come, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me to Captain <hi>Mor:</hi> Then Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Mor</hi> enquired of me if I had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to paſs into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and where my Licence was; I told him I had left it with the Proveditor of the Houſe of <hi>India;</hi> Then he asked me if I knew any one at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> I told him no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then he ſaid do not go out of this Iſland without my Licence firſt had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gave me a Line or two to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, and I had my Cheſt again, but my Money was gone.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:61482:169"/>
After all theſe Troubles, walking one day about the Iſland, I went to viſit a Portugal Gentleman of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who lodged in a <hi>Horte,</hi> or Garden of <hi>Franciſco Mendy,</hi> Judge of the Orphans: Theſe two offered me a place to make a Cabin of Palm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which I gladly accepted; and went to Lodge there; tho' the Lizards and Ants came quite under my Beds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This <hi>Franciſco Mendy</hi> kept Slaves, and ſent me every day a great many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He had a great mind that I ſhould ſtay and live there, promiſing to give me one of his Nieces to Wife, Daughter to the Captain of <hi>Cumana,</hi> from whence the Gold comes; But I had no to mind tarry there, but rather purſue my Voyage to the <hi>East Indies.</hi>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61482:169"/>
called <hi>Antac,</hi> gotten by having to do with the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Women, and there is no other Remedy whereby to be exempted from Death but this: The Root is taken, ground, with clear Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the weight of a Crown, which makes the Patient ſweat ſo, that in a ſhort time it Cures him. 'Tis a little bitter, and yet the Taſte and Smell is agreeable enough. I bargained with ſome of theſe Blacks to fill me a Sack therewith, who led me into the Woods to look for it.</p>
               <p>Going along with them I found a thouſand ſorts of Plants and Fruits to me unknown: At laſt we entered into a little Field, where we found ſome Blacks keeping of Corm for fear of the Elephants, who have Ropes which reach the length of the Corn, with Stones hanging thereon; As ſoon as <note place="margin">Manner to Hunt the Elephants.</note> the Elephants approach, they ſhake theſe Stones againſt one another, which makes ſuch a noiſe, that it frights the Elephants away: In the night they make Fires, which theſe Animals fear mightily.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61482:170"/>
Having ſeen this, we retired to the Habitation where they had prepared my Dinner<hi>:</hi> There I made the Seamen Drink ſo much that they had like to have overturned our Boat. This Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor was called <hi>Sura,</hi> a ſort of Wine made of Palms; and I was mightily troubled to ſee theſe <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſo puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled that they could ſcarce put up the Sails; and in the mean time the Boat was full of Water: One of the Wives of theſe Blacks tumbled into the Sea, but I recovered her, otherwiſe ſhe had been Drowned. Theſe Men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not one another they were ſo Drunk; but as good fortune would have it, the <hi>Mocadon,</hi> or Guider of the <hi>Almadie,</hi> was not ſo Drunk as the reſt. 'Twas looked upon as a Miracle how we paſſed from <hi>Great Cabaſſiere</hi> to the little one, where there was a thouſand Nets, Trees, and Branches, fixed all along the Coaſt to catch Fiſh withall.</p>
               <p>Having then more happily than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently paſſed as far as the <hi>Little Cabaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiere,</hi> we went on Shore to provide freſh Water; but there was none but in a great Well where there was but little neither: The Mariners were
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61482:170"/>
there making Proviſion of Water, ſo that I could not have any till night.</p>
               <p>The night being come, and not knowing where to Lodge, theſe <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians</hi> led me to a place above a League and a half from thence, but the People would not receive us, ſo that we were forced to return to the Port by reaſon of bad Weather: At laſt, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Port, I laid me down in the <hi>Almadie,</hi> covering my ſelf with my Cloak, where I endured the Rain all the night.</p>
               <p>The next morning we hoiſed Sail, and ſailed directly upon the Banks, from whence we had much ado to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: In the end, being come off there from, with a great deal of trouble, and the Wind carrying us by force to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Main-Sea, which did us that favour as to bring us near to the Chapel of the Bullwork, where being come, I made a Vow, never to truſt my ſelf with ſuch Mariners again, who made me run the greateſt hazard I ever had in the whole Voyage: I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my Water to be brought into my Cabin, and prepared my ſelf for the Embarkment to <hi>Goa.</hi>

Whilſt I was in this place, there <note place="margin">White Prince of the Blacks.</note> came the Son of an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> King, from a great diſtance in the Continent, to ſee ſome of his Kindred: His Father and Mother were black, and he was white and fair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He brought with him one of his Brothers, who was black, and ſome Slaves: They came both into my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, telling me, that having heard ſay there was white Men at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> they came purpoſely to ſee them.</p>
               <p>The Portugals made him a very good Reception, to the end they might have Free-Traffick in his Fathers Country: 'Twas ſaid his Mother had two other White Children; but that his Father killed them, ſaying, they muſt needs be by ſome other Man; and that as he came into the World with this colour, his Father had determined to kill him alſo; but one of his Friends perſuaded him to the contrary by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that it was by Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and ſo was ſaved. His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had poſſibly had theſe Men in her Imagination which were ſaid to be at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> or elſe had happened to her by ſome other Courſe of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

or Burnt with the Sun, and was about 20 years of Age, and his Brother about 18. They viſited me 2 or 3 times in my Cabin, and I gave them to Eat and Drink of what <hi>I</hi> could have in the Country, at which they ſeemed to be very well Content.</p>
               <p>I remember that being at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> I heard a Story of ſuch a like thing <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:61482:172"/>
or to kill it: But the Servant moved with Compaſſion, (beſides the Mother had recommended it to him) ſaved the Child, and cauſed it to be brought up, making the Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had made it away: A little while after, this <hi>Genoua,</hi> fore vexed with Spite and Anger, forſook <hi>Genoua,</hi> and retired into <hi>Barbary,</hi> reſolving to turn Turk, and live in <hi>Algier.</hi> In the mean time the poor Diſconſolate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther took care to bring up this Child to years of Diſcretion, and gave him Order to go ſeek his Father through the World; for none knew what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him. This young Black be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Sea, was taken by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs, and carried to <hi>Argier</hi> to be ſold, where he was bought by his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but being troubled to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf become a miſerable Slave, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asked him whence he was, who learned of him the whole Hiſtory of his Birth, at which being aſtoniſhed, he acknowledged him for his Son, and reſolved to quit the Country, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with him to <hi>Genoua,</hi> and to be reconciled to his Wife: Wherefore having ſecretly provided for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

reſolved to embark all his choiceſt things, and what he eſteemed the moſt, they departed one night out of <hi>Algier</hi> in a Boat; but as ill fortune would have it, they were taken by <hi>Corſairs,</hi> by whom they were both cruelly Maſſacred: Such end had the Adventure of this poor Black.</p>

               <p>But it happened by chance that in the ſame Ship that was thus loſt, there was a Perſian Ambaſſador who had been ſent into <hi>Europe</hi> from the great <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to demand ſuccour of the Chriſtian Princes againſt the Turk. This Ambaſſador having been well received, and amongſt others by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with noble and rich Preſents, he returned in this Ship by the way of the <hi>Indies.</hi> I ſaw him at <hi>Lisbon</hi> march about the City in great State, and had his Turbant covered with precious Stones. Now this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, who ſaved himſelf among theſe poor Wretches, fell upon his Knees before the King, deſiring, that he would pleaſe to give theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians their Lives, ſeeing he had taken

from them all they had, and ſuffer them to Embark in ſome Port of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; telling him amongſt other things, that if he knew but the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> he would not offer them the leaſt Injury, and that their Prince was able in a little time to Ruin him.

               <p>The Portugals ſeeing this, were not a little glad to have their Lives ſaved, got away Naked as they were, and Embarked in a Ship of an <hi>Arabian,</hi> Trafficking upon the Coaſt of <hi>India,</hi> who gave them Victuals and Paſſage upon hopes to be recompenced at <hi>Goa;</hi> and being arrived, the Maſter came to demand his Hire and Charges, but <note place="margin">Good Office ill requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One of theſe Seamen that were ſaved being my Friend, told me, That the Maſter Cannonier mightily lamented the loſs of a Stone of a ſtrange Virtue
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61482:178"/>
and excellent Odour, for having it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">Odoriferent Stone.</note> him, he ſeemed to have a Scent of Musk and Ambergreece: The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was ſuch, that being Soaked in Water, it was an excellent Remedy againſt any Diſeaſe, and had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced it upon ſeveral of their Men, who as ſoon as they drank of the Water wherein it was ſoaked, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves preſently eaſed, and were cured according to the quantity which they took. The aptain would have given him a 1000 Duckets for it, but he would not take under 3 or 4000. He came by it one day as they made a Halt, taking his Harquebuſs, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Woods to ſhoot ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Eat, he found an Animal of the bigneſs of a Deer, but a little higher, who had two Horns below the Eyes, <note place="margin">Animal carrying an excellent Stone.</note> and had the fortune to ſhoot him in the Head: This Beaſt gave a leap to run upon him, but he fell down dead. He and his Companions cut him up to Roaſt him upon the Coals; and as he was going to Eat ſome of the Pluck, he found this Stone in a little bag, which at firſt he made no account of; but having waſhed it he found it of ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb facs="tcp:61482:179"/>
and poliſhed bright colour, and of ſo ſweet a ſmell, that he kept it up carefully. The Coaſt of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> is full of excellent and odoriferous Herbs, and perhaps this Animal might feed thereupon, and that may be the cauſe of the Virtue of the Stone.</p>
               <p>Thus was the greateſt part of the Fleet loſt: For of 14 Veſſels there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived but 4 at the <hi>Indies,</hi> with a Hulk which ſerved us for a Patach, yet not without having the Maſts broke in pieces.

by no means give his Conſent, tho' the Daughter was very willing he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to rid himſelf of the Father, and for this cauſe parted one day from <hi>Goa,</hi> with ſome of his Sworn Companions, with whom he Embark'd, and coming late in the evening to <hi>Bombain,</hi> they watched their opportunity, ſo that they found this Captain walking along by the Sea, and there killed him. This was ſo ſecretly done that <hi>Soſa</hi> had no great trouble to attain to his Deſires, Marrying this fair Orphan named <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> whom he brought to <hi>Goa;</hi> where having for ſome time lived in pleaſure with her, and having two Children by her, he had a deſire to go with his Family to <hi>Portugal,</hi> to obtain from the King ſome Preferment greater than that which he had in the <hi>Indies:</hi> And for this cauſe, having bought a good Ship, and being Embarked at <hi>Cochim,</hi> with his Wife and Children, a great many Slaves, and others of his Train, he ſailed away; But coming towards the Cape of <hi>Currants,</hi> and their Veſſel running a-ground, they were forced to ſave themſelves in the Boat: They thought to have arrived at the <hi>Little</hi>

down about the Woods ſeeking for Raiſins to nouriſh himſelf, his Wife, and Children: But the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Compaſſion was this poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lady, who ſeeing her ſelf Naked, covered her ſelf with Sand, that ſhe might not be ſeen in this Condition, and made the greateſt Lamentations imaginable, oftentimes telling her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that their great Sins were the cauſe of ſo many Evils: But having continued ſome days in this Miſery, after ſuffering the Death of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, overwhelmed with Grief, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and all ſorts of Incommodities, was found dying by the wretched <hi>Soſa,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from his Queſt; yet he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her laſt Sighs, with Complaints and Lamentations of his loſs; and knowing himſelf to be the cauſe of all theſe Misfortunes, went away like a Mad Man about the Woods, and was never after heard of. All the reſt of his Company died after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, except one Portugal, who with great difficulty eſcaped, and arrived at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> where he related this ſad Story, of which the Portugals have made a Romance.

               <p>I went to live in his Houſe till we Embarkt, which was in <hi>January</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: It was in <hi>November</hi> when he ſent for me to this Paſs, where there was a Captain who kept the Paſſage ſo that none could go into the Main-Land without being marked in the Hand, except thoſe of the Country, and the Portugals, who muſt have the Licence of the <hi>Coregidor.</hi> I deſired then this Captain from <hi>Andre Furtado,</hi> to give me an <hi>Almadie,</hi> with Mariners,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61482:183"/>
and a Naique for Guide, which he willingly did, and recommended me mightily to this Naique, telling him that I went to look for Herbs for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre Furtado,</hi> which was true, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly brought ſome which ſerved him for Fomentation of the Opelation of the Spleen. Paſſing then to the Main-Land, we went by theſe Places in the Habitations of the Gentlemen <hi>Bramenis;</hi> and having demanded ſome Water to drink at the Houſe of one of theſe People, he gave me ſome, but ſtayed to ſee if I drank without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſides of the Cup, the which I knew not, and Drank without any Ceremony, which the Son of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſeeing, cried out as loud as he could to his Father, who was in a little place behind the Houſe, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came running in great Ange, ſo that I was conſtrained to march of, and make clean the Cup by my Naique to appeaſe them.</p>
               <p>After that I paſſed by a Pagod or Temple, very well built, and entering therein I found one of the Natives ſtark-naked, adorning their Idol with Flowers, which had a Head like a
<pb facs="tcp:61482:184"/>
Calf, when preſently an old Woman amongſt them cried out to me, Why I came in there with my Shooes; my Naique excuſed me in telling her that I knew not the Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>As for the Pay-gods, they have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">Paygods.</note> ſorts of them; Some for War, others for Peace, and for Love, where the Maids coming to be Married, are brought to be Deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oured; and their Idol hath the Privy Parts like a Man. The Damſels, who ſerve theſe Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods like the Veſtal-Virgins, continue there from 10 to 20 years of Age, and Dance all night long, carrying lighted Lamps in their Hands, and go to Sleep round about their Idols. I ſaw there very beautiful Girls and Women They Marry their Daughters at 8 or 9 years of Age; when they are once paſt 12 or 13, they are not regarded, becauſe they believe them to continue no longer Maids, conſidering the heat of the Country: At the end of 20 years, theſe Religious Women that <note place="margin">Indian <hi>Women Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</hi>
                  </note> have thus ſerved the Pay-gods, are kept in a certain place the reſt of their Lives.</p>
               <p>After I had gathered ſome Herbs which I had occaſion for, we went to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61482:184"/>
a little Habitation of Gentiles, where I demanded by my <hi>Truch-man,</hi> if they had any Victuals to give us for our Money, for there is no Inns or Taverns there; but there were ſome little Shops where they ſold Fruit, and other things fit to Eat: Theſe Gentiles ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Compaſſion on me, there was a Woman, who put me under a Gallery of her Houſe, where there was a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin full of Leaves and Plantane, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with Thorns; then ſhe threw me ſome Rice thereupon, with a certain Sauce which they call <hi>Caril,</hi> I Eat all this, and when I was about to Drink out of a little Veſſel of Copper that they had given me full of Water, they began to cry out upon me, becauſe I touched it in Drinking, for they never touch the Cup in Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, only heaving it up with the Server whereon it ſtands, and ſo Drink.</p>
               <p>The Floor and Pavement of their Houſes are compoſed with Cow-Dung, <note place="margin">Ants trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome.</note> which they make look exceeding bright, and think that it keeps away the Ants, which are there in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and they can keep nothing free from being deſtroy'd by theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:61482:185"/>
Animals, to prevent which they have alſo Cupboards bore upon Piles, ſet in Veſſels full of Water, where the Ants drown themſelves by thinking to mount up. Near to this Habitation I found a great Tree, laden with <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marins,</hi> of which I gathered a few: <note place="margin">Tamarins.</note> They had yet nothing but a ſower Taſte, I carried away the Husk, which are almoſt like French-Beans, but lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and greater.</p>
               <p>Now as I returned by a very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart Place, I ſaw ſome of theſe Gentiles running in great haſte; and having cauſed my Truch-man to ask what ailed them, they anſwered, that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was gone to Drown himſelf, a little after I ſaw them return, bringing back their Father, and Comforting him after the beſt manner they could: He was troubled for ſome Misfortune that had happened to him. It is a common thing with theſe People to Drown or Poiſon themſelves, or to <note place="margin">Indians <hi>ſubject to Diſpair.</hi>
                  </note> Die after ſome ſuch way, when any Accident happens to them.</p>
               <p>As for the Women, 'tis the Cuſtom, that when the Body of their Dead Husbands are Burnt, they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61482:185"/>
into the Funeral Pile, and Burn <note place="margin">Women who burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> themſelves, after being firſt adorned with their richeſt Accoutrements and Jewels, Dancing at the Sound of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and thus Die with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Conſtancy, ſpeaking in the Fire to the very laſt: Thoſe who do not this are held Infamous ſo long as they live, not daring to ſhew themſelves before others, nor to appear before their Friends and Kindred. Such as have a weaker Courage Poiſon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeeing their Husband Dead, and are Burnt together with him.</p>
               <p>Tis remarkable that the Body of the Woman hath ſuch an Oyley Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that one Body will ſerve like Oil or Greeſe to conſume the Bodies of 5 or 6 men. The Moors and Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans who inhabit the Main-Land of <hi>Goa</hi> towards <hi>Pichelin,</hi> do not allow this ſort of Cruelty in the Women; but when they ſee they cannot obtain this favour, they Poiſon themſelves.</p>
               <p>This Cuſtom of Burning themſelves hath continued, as they ſay, ever ſince a certain Gentile King, who reigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; who ſeeing how all the Men of his Kingdom died, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:61482:186"/>
that it was their Wives which Poiſoned them, to have other Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; and that thoſe who had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould continue alive to take care of them, but without Power ever to Marry again, inſtituted this: They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this very ſtrictly, and do nothing but Groan, Weep and Lament, during the reſt of their Life; and at certain hours of the day and night, howl and lament after ſo ſtrange a manner, that 'tis a great pity to hear them.</p>
               <p>As for my part I was ſometimes Deafened with the clamours and noiſe of ſome or other who had loſt Husband or Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have heard a <hi>Bramin</hi> ſay, (who had turned Chriſtian) that they who have loſt a Child, mourn and lament 20 years entire: He told me alſo, that a certain Woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of thoſe who us'd to ſerve the Pay-gods, that after being retired into a Houſe where they paſs their time with Men, ſhe entertained one who heated himſelf ſo with her, that he Died upon the ſpot, <note place="margin">Reſolution of a Lover.</note> at which ſhe was ſo afflicted, that when they Burnt his Body, ſhe Burnt her ſelf with him, ſeeing he had Died for Love of her, tho' ſhe was no other than a good Friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:61482:186"/>
As I returned from my little Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, I paſſed by a Valley where there was a very neat and pleaſant Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which came out from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ock flat and hollow, and the Water which came out run through little holes in the Rock: 'Twas impoſſible to empty it, though there was but very little Water therein: For in taking out that which was there, more runs out, like a ſtrong and active Spring: After this, I went to Embark at a Paygod, which is in a certain place along by the River, it being ſo deep that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find the bottom. They have made there large and ſpacious <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fooliſh Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the</hi> Indians.</note> Steps along by the ſide; and there the Gentiles come every year, 2 or 300 Leagues diſtant, to waſh themſelves at certain times, and ſometimes there are aſſembled there above a 100000 Men, Women and Children, caſting abundance of Fruit in this River, who believe that at the end of the year it comes again upon the Water. Thus Satan deceives them, for there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome or other who tarry the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for ſecurity, who ſometimes drown themſelves out of a Pond Devotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61482:187"/>
As I Embarked by theſe Steps, I <note place="margin">Another Voyage of the Author.</note> returned to the <hi>Madre di Dios,</hi> from whence I ſet out about <hi>Dec.</hi> Then I made another little Voyage to the Main-Land of <hi>Pichelin,</hi> to procure ſome <note place="margin">Pichelin.</note> Drugs and other Rarities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and took again my Truch-man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the <hi>Almadie,</hi> and the Mariners which the Captain of the Paſſage had given me, who having expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to Obey me, and to conduct me where I had a mind to go.</p>
               <p>We departed in a very fine evening, and travelled all night, the Moon ſhining, inſomuch that we arrived at <hi>Pichelin,</hi> a very pleaſant City, where is a great number of Gentile Merchants, and belongs to <hi>Dealcan,</hi> it being ſome 4 Leagues from <hi>Goa:</hi> We went to the Lodging of one <hi>Manate,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> a Gentile, who received us kindly upon the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he had with our Truch-man, and put me to lie under a little Pent-Houſe, where an Indian Woman brought her Daughter to lie with me, as this <hi>Manate</hi> had counſelled her; but this Girl not above 13 years of Age, ſeeing I would not touch her, ſell to Weeping and Groaning, thinking to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61482:187"/>
force me to have to do with her, and her Mother did all ſhe could to appeaſe her; I underſtood not the ground of all this Myſtery.</p>
               <p>The next morning, I ſaw a Jogue-Gentile, who was all perfumed with Incenſe, and ſtark Naked, ſquat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Tail before a Fire of Cow Dung, and with Aſhes thereof all bepowered his Body, having long Hair like a Woman, which he held on the top of his Shoulders: This was the moſt hideous and monſtrous Spectacle that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Strange fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the</hi> Jogues.</note> ever was ſeen: For he remained ſtill looking on the Fire, without ſo much as turning his Head.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſort of People are ſometimes 4 or 5 days without any meat, and uſe extraordinary Abſtinence: All theſe Gentiles, and eſpecially the Bramins, never Eat any living thing, or that has had life, and will not taſte of Red-Herbs, ſaying, that they have Blood in them; They Eat Rice and Milk, and call the Cow their Mother-Nurſe. About the Deſarts they have Hoſpitals where they Feed the Pilgrims that paſs that way: When ſome rich Men <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſpitals amongſt the</hi> Indians.</note> Die they leave ſomething to the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61482:188"/>
To this purpoſe, I will relate what happened to one of my Friends, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu</hi> to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin:</hi> This was a Fleming, who was Married at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and had two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Cochin.</note> Married at <hi>Goa,</hi> to the <hi>Metices</hi> of <hi>Cochin:</hi> Theſe 3 were taken in the Ship <hi>Good Jeſus</hi> by the Hollanders, who put them on Shore; And as they came along by the Sea-ſide, they had but one pair of Shoes amongſt them three, the which they wore by turns: He who wore the Shoes went upon Land, and the two others, bare-footed, went in the Water along by the Shore, not enduring the Soles of their Feet upon the Ground, it was ſo hot and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time<hi>:</hi> They were ready to Die with Hunger and Thirſt, not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to ſubſiſt upon in theſe Deſarts: And being very weak, and in great Diſtreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they eſpied two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who ran towards them, crying out to them to ſtay a little; but they not knowing what they meant, feared at firſt that it was to Rob them, but having nothing to loſe, they reſolved to tarry, and theſe Gentiles being come to them, courteouſly offered them Meat <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Courteſie of the</hi> Indians</note>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:61482:188"/>
and Drink, for which they thanked them, ſaying, they had no Money to pay for it: They ſpake by Signs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not being able to make them underſtand otherways: But theſe Gentiles pointed towards Heaven, as if they would have ſaid, 'twas God who commanded them to do thus; ſo that theſe 3 eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereto, and afterwards purſued their Voyage<hi>:</hi> This ſhews how theſe Gentiles are content when they find occaſion to do good to poor Travellers, they being all very pious People, who endure all ſorts of Ignominy and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſuch Lovers are they of Peace and Tranquillity. This Goodneſs and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Humanity of theſe poor Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, abuſed in ſo many other things, is an excellent Leſſon for Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the True Religion, which they make ſo little account of, ſince the Natural Light of theſe blind Infidels, ſhames the Super-natural Gifts of thoſe who profeſs Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>After I had gathered together, and bought all the Drugs and other Things which might be of any uſe to me, I began to think of my return with my Truchman and Mariners; and going
<pb facs="tcp:61482:189"/>
along the Coaſt, which was very green, pleaſant, and abounding in all ſorts of Plants; When I ſaw any Herb which pleaſed me, I commanded them to fetch it.</p>
               <p>The Portugals put a thouſand Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts upon theſe poor People, and ſometimes they make ſhew as if they would kill ſome Bird, or other Animal, <note place="margin">Indians <hi>kill not Animals.</hi>
                  </note> which theſe Gentiles have pity on, and preſently buy them to ſet them at liberty: Yet ſince they have found out that the Portugals do this on purpoſe to have their Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowing their bad Intention, they buy not theſe Animals as they were wont to do.</p>
               <p>When a Portugal has a mind to have <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rude Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the</hi> Indies.</note> ſome new Cloths, he makes no more ado but goes to the Shop of an Indian, with a Tailor, and there chooſes his Stuff; then orders it to be cut out in his preſence, and when it comes to be paid, he bids the poor Gentile follow him to his Lodging to take his Money, where being come, he pretends that his Companion, who has the Key of his Cheſt, is not there; and ſo the other whatever he can ſay or do, can have nothing of him but this excuſe: And
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61482:189"/>
2 or 3 days after, the Portugal tells him he owes him nothing: They uſe the ſame Tricks to all other Merchants, and Tradeſmen: They have done as much to me, when I have paid any thing for them; for ſome time after they made as if they knew me not: Yet it ought not to be thought ſtrange if they do thus in the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſince they play the ſame Pranks in <hi>Lisbon</hi> it ſelf; where one of my Hoſts told me, that one day having Dreſſed up a Hat for a <hi>Caſtilian,</hi> and asking him for his Mony, ſhewed him a Piſtol cockt, telling him, if he had a mind to be paid, he muſt follow him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he was going, and this was all he could get.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they arrive at the <hi>Indies,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nature and Quality of the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals <hi>in the</hi> Indians.</note> they make themſelves Gallants, calling themſelves <hi>Fidalgues,</hi> or Gentlemen, tho they be but Peaſants and Tradeſmen: They themſelves relate, That a certain one among them named <hi>Fernando,</hi> who had kept Hogs in <hi>Portugal,</hi> coming to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and adding 3 Letters to his Name, cauſed himſelf to be called <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and was in a little time ſo well known and eſteemed amongſt the Women <hi>Metices,</hi> that one having choſen
<pb facs="tcp:61482:190"/>
him for her Servant, ſhe cauſed him to Ride about with a Chain of Gold about his Neck, and a great many Slaves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; But one day it happened that his Maſter's Son, whom he had ſerved in his own Country for a Swine-heard, <note place="margin">Portugal <hi>Pride.</hi>
                  </note> having met him in this Rich Equipage, riding about the Streets of <hi>Goa,</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him, ſaying in his own Language, <hi>Deos Guarde de Fernando Como Eſta;</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>God ſave ye Fernando, how goes it:</hi> But the other making ſhew as if he knew him not, ask'd, who he was; to which the other made anſwer, Was not he the ſame who formerly kept Hogs for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; This Gallant hearing this, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him aſide, told him, he was, and was here called <hi>Don,</hi> and was looked upon as a great Gentleman, praying him to hold his peace, and gave him Money; yet this hindered not his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known by ſeveral, who made their own profit thereof.</p>
               <p>But ſince I am fallen upon this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I will add, that when theſe Portugal Soldiers firſt arrive at the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> wearing their Country Cloths, thoſe who have been there a long time
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61482:190"/>
before, when they ſee them walk about the Streets, call them <hi>Reipol,</hi> laden with Lice, with a thouſand other Jeers and Affronts: When I was there, theſe Newcomers durſt not ſtir out of their Lodgings until they were dreſs'd like the other Indians; And then they know them no longer, uſing Majeſtick Gravity, and obſerving the <hi>Soſſiego,</hi> after the Spaniſh manner, always ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Boy, who carries their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſol,</hi> or Cloak; without which they dare not come out of their Lodging, except they have a mind to be eſteem'd <hi>Picaro's,</hi> or poor miſerable Wretches; as in truth they are to thoſe who know them: As long as they are there, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of vile and baſe, as they be, they eſteem themſelves all <hi>Fidalques</hi> and Noblemen, changing their more obſcure Names to more Illuſtrious<hi>:</hi> I knew one who Enrolled himſelf for the War, and he changed his Name 3 or 4 times, as 'twas found out by the Secretaries and Regiſters of <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they hear of any one that knows them, they are ſo wicked as to ſend to ask whether he knew ſuch a one or not, and who he was, of what
<pb facs="tcp:61482:191"/>
Caſt or Race, and if noble and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo that if the other anſwers, that he is ſome <hi>Picaron,</hi> or miſerable Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, this Friend reports it to the other, and then for meer Spite, complots with his Aſſociates againſt him who has told this Truth, and meeting him in the City at their advantage, give him ſo many Blows that they kill him, or leave him for Dead: This is the cauſe that one muſt take care how he tells the Truth of ſuch who are enquired after: But on the contrary, if they tell all the glorious Things in the world of him, of his Nobility, Valour, Power, and other Qualities, tho' never ſo falſe; Then he of whom all this is meant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meet the other, immediately ſalutes him, Embraces his Thigh, and prays him always to ſay the ſame of him, and that he is wholly at his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ready to reward him with his Life and Fortune.</p>
               <p>When they have a mind to <hi>d'Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chillar,</hi> or Slaſh any one with their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Revenge of the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</note> Swords, they ſend Notes to their Friends to deſire their aſſiſtance againſt one who has offended them<hi>:</hi> If he to whom this Note is ſent does not come,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61482:191"/>
and excuſes himſelf, becauſe ſuch an one is his Friend, they cry him about for a faint-hearted Coward; and 'tis he on whom they will wrack their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, if he has not a care of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe are the Actions at this day.</p>
               <p>One day ſtanding at my Lodging Door in the Street of the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> I ſaw two Companies of Soldiers, the one coming from the <hi>Miſericordia,</hi> and the other ſeeming from the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> and drawing nigh one to the other, laid hands upon their Swords with great fury, but the Raſcals did one another no harm, being the numbers were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual<hi>:</hi> But when 10 or 12 meets with one or two, then you ſhall ſee them do wonderful Exploits.</p>
               <p>There was one amongſt the reſt, who to ſhew himſelf a Champion, challeng'd another to fight him hand to hand, who appear'd but plainly with his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:61482:192"/>
if he had a mind to have his Life given him, there was one thing he muſt do, and the other demanded, what it was; this Wretch who had his piece cockt, told him that he muſt deny <hi>Jeſus</hi>

                  <hi>Cbriſt,</hi> which the other having baſely done, he firing, ſaid to him, get thee the right way to Hell, and ſo parted.</p>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible to tell the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inſolencies, and Irreverences they <note place="margin">Irreverence in the Churches.</note> commit in the Churches during Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service; which I have often ſeen, whilſt they were ſaying Maſs at <hi>Goa,</hi> hearing them ſpeak out aloud, and crying ſo to one another, that none could hear any thing of the Service, making all that noiſe in the Indian Language, and bawling as if they were in a Fair, or in the Fields; and ſome will ſend their Slaves to fetch their <hi>Eſcritorio</hi> to take ſome Letters out <note place="margin">Eſcritorio</note> to ſhew: Then when they ſee the Holy Sacrament raiſing, they give themſelves 3 or 5 blows upon the Breaſt, and preſently fall again to Bawling, Laughing, and Mocking as before: There is nothing amongſt them but Uſury, Covetouſneſs, Theft, and ſtrange Oaths, and ſuch that the

A Portugal Gentleman related to me how he had been thus Robb'd by that ſort of People, as he was going to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; For his Slave having opened the Door upon their telling him they had a word or two to ſay to his Maſter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in by force, and leaving one at the Door, took at the firſt bout all the Plate which was upon the Table, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of him 200 Cheraphins if he had a mind to have them again, which he gave them, and ſo they went away. If the Juſtice goes to take them, they have great Bags of Cannon-Powder, with Matches tied about them, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to throw them amongſt thoſe who offer to approach the Door.</p>
               <p>The Portugals are grown ſo extream jealous of their Wives that you muſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jealouſie of the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</note> not ſo much as look them in the Face; and if they ſee them but ſpeak to any one, they preſently Strangle or Poiſon them; and when they have Strangled them, they call their Neighbours to their Succour, ſaying, that a Swooning Fit has taken their Wife upon the Chair; But they never come again to themſelves: Sometimes they ſend for a Barber to Blood them, ſaying, that they are not well; When the Barber is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61482:193"/>
gone away, they undo the Fillet, and let he Blood run out until the poor miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creature dies; and then alſo they call in the Neighbours, to ſee as they ſay, what a ſad Diſaſter has happened to their Wife in Sleeping.</p>
               <p>Others there are who take their Wives with them to Bath in ſome Brook or Pond, and there make them Drink their Belly full; and a little while after, ſend their Slaves to look for their Miſtreſs, whom they find Drown'd, which the Husband knowing before, ſeems to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mightily aſtoniſhed and grieved at.</p>
               <p>Thus in different ways, they make away their Wives, on the leaſt ſuſpicion, and afterwards relate the Story amongſt one another<hi>:</hi> There are ſome who have thus made away 3 or 4 Wives.</p>
               <p>But the Women alſo, when they think their Husbands entertain any other, rid themſelves of them by Poiſon, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and make much uſe of the Seeds of <hi>Datura,</hi> which has a ſtrange Virtue; <note place="margin">Datura <hi>Poiſon.</hi>
                  </note> This <hi>Datura,</hi> or <hi>Dutroa,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium,</hi> is a great and high Plant, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing white Flowers, like the <hi>Ciſampelos,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ciſampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los.</note> but larger. Now he who takes too great a quantity thereof, Dies in a little time, laughing and weeping like a Fool.
<pb facs="tcp:61482:194"/>
Thus the Women who have particular Friends, gave of this Herb to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, mixing therewith other Drugs, which is ſuch that the poor Husband falls into a Fury, and Raving, ſnatches <note place="margin">Strange Actions.</note> up a Pike or Hallberd to guard the Door, without ſaying a word to ſuch as come either in or out: Then the <hi>Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ora</hi> or <hi>Lady,</hi> ſends for her Gallant, and paſſes the time in preſence of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band until the Operation of the Drug (which continues about 24 hours) is over: He who has taken it, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what he has ſeen or done, ſo mightily are his Thoughts and Mind agitated and troubled with this Herb.</p>
               <p>As for the Slaves, 'tis pity to ſee the <note place="margin">Cruel Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement to the Slaves.</note> cruel Chaſtiſements they give them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For they run them through with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Irons, then give them with a Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, 500 blows at a time, and make them lie along the ground on their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then comes two, who by turns ſtrike the poor Body as a Log of Wood, the Maſter Portugal or <hi>Metice</hi> being preſent, counts the Blows with his <hi>Roſaire:</hi> And if by chance they who thus ſtrike are not ſtrong enough to his mind, or have an inclination to ſpare their Companion, he cauſes them to be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61482:194"/>
put in the place of the Patient, and to be ſoundly banged without any Mercy.</p>
               <p>As I was in my Lodging at <hi>Goa,</hi> I heard nothing but Blows all the night long, and ſome weak Voice, which Breathed a little, for they ſtop their Mouth with a Linnen Cloth, to hinder them from crying out. After they have been well beaten, they cauſe their Bodies to be ſliced with a Razor, then rub it with Salt and Vinegar for fear it ſhould Feſter.</p>
               <p>They have another ſort of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they call <hi>Pingar Viue,</hi> which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cruelty of the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</note> is to drop Lard put into a red hot <hi>Pelle,</hi> upon the Body of the poor Patient, ſtark naked and lying upon his Belly. The Parents of theſe miſerable Wretches are ſorry they brought them into the World, to feel ſuch Torments, which pierces them to the very Entrails.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes ſeen part of theſe Barbarous Cruelties which afflicted me ſo much, that I have ſtill a horrour when I think thereof. There was one day a poor Indian Girl, who came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to my Lodging, crying out for help, and praying me to be a means to obtain Mercy; but I could not ſave her, to my great Sorrow; For ſhe was
<pb facs="tcp:61482:195"/>
taken and laid all along on the Ground and Baſtinadoed without pity.</p>
               <p>There was a <hi>Metice</hi> Woman who had by theſe horrible Chaſtiſements killed 5 or 6 Slaves, which ſhe cauſed to be Buried in her Garden; And one day as ſhe ordered another to be thus puniſhed, he who gave her the Blows going to leave off, the miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the mean time Died; and when <note place="margin">

               <p>I have found out in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that the Whoredoms, Ambition, Avarice, and Greedineſs of the Portugals, has been one of the chiefeſt cauſes why the <hi>Indians</hi> become not Chriſtians ſo eaſily: This is the Reaſon why the People of the Portugal Churches, who are in thoſe parts, mightily deſire ſome French, Dutch, or Scots to be with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe People lead a life leſs impure and ſcandalous; which is the thing that moſt chiefly maintains and upholds Religion in that part of the World.

               <p>But to return to <hi>Goa,</hi> I think it not much amiſs to relate what a Portugal Gentleman told me of their Adventures, which was that once going to War towards the South Sea, with the Naval Army of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liots, (which every year go out againſt the <hi>Malabars)</hi> about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> when their Winter is paſt, and at the ſame time another Army goes out to the North Sea, which is towards the Red Sea.</p>
               <p>The Captains of the Army held Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil together to go into a Habitation of the Gentiles, along by the Coaſt near to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> to take away by force a Golden Pagod, very great, with other little ones, who were in a certain Temple there: But foraſmuch as theſe Gentiles were Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates with the Portugals, they would not do this enterpriſe in the day-time, but went one night to go aſhore in this little City, not far from the Sea, where the Pagod was, and ſetting foot on Land, they ſet Fire in every place to fright theſe poor People, and ſo went ſtraight to the Pagod, but the Fire paſſed ſo quickly, that before they had Power to take the Idol it forced
<pb facs="tcp:61482:210"/>
them to retire a little faſter than they came, and had no more time than only to ſnatch the Pendants and Rings from the Ears and Fingers of theſe poor Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Women, who were ſhut up, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all the night in their Pagod, according to their Cuſtom: They were near 500, and ſeeing the Enemy entering, they all aſſembled themſelves together, faſtening their Legs and Arms one within another, that 'twas impoſſible for the Portugals to draw ſo much as one of them out: But ſeeing the Fire at their Heels, they only ſnatched away the Jewels from their Ears, their Fingers they cruelly cut off to have the Rings, and they made ſuch a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table noiſe, that 'twas a great pity to hear them: The Portugals flying away from the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ire, left all theſe Religious young Women to be Burnt, none being able to ſuccour them; and thus cruelly do the Portugals treat their beſt Friends and Confederates: He who related to me this pitious Hiſtory, was named Don <hi>Louts Lobe,</hi> who was of this enterpriſe, and told me, that this uproar moved him from his very Heart to Pity.</p>
               <p>As for what concerns the City of <hi>Goa,</hi> and the Country round about, I pretend not here to make an exact and ample Diſcription; yet I deſire the Reader to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61482:210"/>
take notice, that that little which I ſpeak is no more than what my Memory was able to furniſh me withall; for being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the places, I was ſo carefully watched, as are all Strangers, and eſpecially the French, that I could put nothing in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; And this was the principal cauſe of my Impriſonment at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> being accuſed of having made a Ruttier of the Sea, which thing the Portugals fear the moſt, not being willing, that the French, Engliſh, or Hollanders, ſhould know any thing of thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>I will ſay of <hi>Goa</hi> in a few words, that it is a City excellent well ſcituated in an Iſland, environed with the River, ſome part level, and other mountainous, and may be about as big as <hi>Tours,</hi> but Peopled with all Nations of <hi>India:</hi> It is very well built, in its Churches, Hoſpitals, Colleges, publick Palaces, and particular Houſes of the Portugals and Natives, which are of a reddiſh Baſtard Marble, and Free-Stone: The other Houſes of the Indians are like Cabins built with Earth, and ſome Stone: They have a great number of Gardens, with <hi>Tanques,</hi> or great Ponds to Bath in, and many Fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trees<hi>:</hi> The Country is good and fertile, bearing Rice twice a year: The Gentiles have liberty of their Religion, but are not ſuffered to have any
<pb facs="tcp:61482:211"/>
Pagod or Temple within the City, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the main-land, and out of the Iſle.</p>
               <p>When theſe Gentiles and Idolaters come to Die, if they leave little Children, the Jeſuits are careful to take and bring them up, and inſtruct them in the Faith; and therefore for their Pains, they ſeize upon their Lands, Inheritances, and Goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Hoſt, a Chriſtian Indian, told me, that he had been ſerved after this manner, without being a jot the better inſtructed.</p>
               <p>As for the Men of War, they are about 1500 or 2000, according as the Fleets arrive. I ſaw a General-Muſter of all the Inhabitants bearing Arms, as well the Portugals as Natives and Indians, and were ſound to be about 4000: They did that, being that time in fear of the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, who ſcowered the Sea with a great number of Veſſels. I neither knew nor met with any Frenchman there, but a good Father Jeſuit, named <hi>Eſtienne de la Croix,</hi> Native of <hi>Roan,</hi> of whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no ſmall kindneſs: I alſo ſaw 3 others, who had eſcaped from the <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dives,</hi> amongſt whom was one named <hi>Francois Pirard,</hi> a Briton, who has Writ the Hiſtory of his Voyages: I was told that 3 Months before I arrived at <hi>Goa,</hi> there went away from thence, a French Gentleman named <hi>de Feynes,</hi> ho cauſed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61482:211"/>
himſelf to be called the Count of <hi>Monſert:</hi> He was mighty skillful in the Art of Blowing up places; which was the cauſe of his Misfortune; for coming from <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> to <hi>Ormus,</hi> as he was diſcourſing there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he knew the way of Blowing up a Fortreſs, was it never ſo ſtrong, he was preſently laid hold of as a Priſoner, and carried to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he was kept in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for fear he would obſerve the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes; and the firſt Fleet that returned to <hi>Portugal,</hi> he was ſent therein, and kept Priſoner at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> until Monſieur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>As for what concerns the Fertility of the Land of <hi>Goa,</hi> and what it produces, I remit you to what has been written by the Portugals; only I ſay, that the Fruit moſt neceſſary for the life of Man, is that of the Palm. This Tree is Spongy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little Strings or Veins environed with a Pellicule, and draws its ſubſtance from the Sandy-Earth, from which it alſo draws great abundance of moiſture, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the greatneſs of the Fruit it bears, and the quantity of <hi>Eſura</hi> or Wine which this Fruit renders.

The Nut thereof is very great, long and black, in form of a Gondale; The Tree that bears this Fruit is not to be ſeen, growing at the bottom of the Sea: but when the Sea is agitated, the Fruit is born from the bottom to the top, and is found upon the Shore.</p>
               <p>I come now to my return, when the Senior <hi>Andre Furtado de Mondoſo</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſent for me to go with him.

               <p>The 15th of <hi>Feb.</hi> we ſaw the Iſle of <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> mightily covered with Fog, and bearing about to paſs the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi> with a favourable Gale of Wind, we paſſed it the 16th of <hi>March.</hi>

thoſe Countries, where I had nothing but bad fortune; and was very well content that I was ſafely returned tho I was not a little indiſpoſed in my perſon, becauſe of theſe ſalt and ſpiced waters, which I had then been forc'd to drink till they ſo heated my Stomack, that my mouth caſt out burning Vapours, and I could ſcaree quench my thirſt.</p>
               <p>At length being reſtored to my health by cooling remedies, and ſeeing my ſelf ſtrong enough to reaſſume the way to my dear native Country, where I had a great deſire to ſee my ſelf again after ſo many ſatigues and dangers, I embarked the 17th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in a Ship belonging to one <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care Simon</hi> of <hi>Rochelle.</hi> and in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was another Ship called alſo the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> But being in the Sea, we were ſo beaten with Storms, that the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> mightily deſired us to keep by them; but one Night in a very great Storm, her Sails ſplit and tore to pieces, they were forced to bend their main Top Sail in ſtead of their main Sail, inſomuch that in the Morning we ſaw her at above 3 Leagues of us, and had put abroad their Enſign to cauſe us to come up to her; which we did as ſoon as might be, and coming near her, we ſaw them crying out for <hi>Miſericorde,</hi> or mercy, for they
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61482:214"/>
were ſinking: We boarded them at the <hi>Poop,</hi> and they ſaved themſelves, who could in our Ship; it was a great pity to ſee them in this extremity: I ſaved one of them along by the ſide, who fell from the Stern of our Ship: Thus was the Ship loſt and all the Merchandiſe that was in her; and afterward we arrived at <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> the 3d of <hi>Sept.</hi> from thence I came to <hi>Paris</hi> the 23 of the ſame Month, when our young King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII.

               </p>
               <p>I had heard no News of the unhappy accident happened in the Perſon of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, my good Maſter, untill we were in ſight of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> for then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom, there came a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel</hi> from the Port to ſee and know who we were, who told us that ſad Hiſtory, which I could ſcarcely believe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Land it was too much confirmed, to my Eternal regret and ſorrow.</p>

an Aſs to carry our Victuals: We left the City the 11th. of <hi>November,</hi> and went over very high Mountains, and troubleſome to paſs, and in the end arrived at the Lodging of a <hi>Chaldean</hi> Archbiſhop, called Father <hi>George,</hi> who received us after the beſt manner he could.

The Father <hi>George</hi> lived there with his Mother, Siſters, and Nieces, making one and the ſame Family altogether. He ſhewed me a Chapel above his Houſe, upon a little Rock, right under Mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and told methere was there a Hole, out of which every Year, upon the 1ſt. Day of <hi>May</hi> only, guſhes an abundance of

Water, at ſuch time as they ſing Maſs in the Chapel. The Mountain is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all over with Cyprus-Trees. The Place is very agreeable; but the Winter is there very troubleſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the exceſſive Cold, and great Snows, which mightily afflicts theſe good Fathers, ſo that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained for that cauſe to paſs the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter near <hi>Tripoly,</hi> and return there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the Spring.</p>
               <p>The next Morning after we had heard Maſs, we ſet forward towards the Place where the Cedars are, about <note place="margin">Cedars.</note> Three Leagues from thence; where being come, we had ſuch a cold blaſt of Wind, that my Turk blew his Fingers: I order'd him to get upon a Cedar-Tree to break me off ſome Branches, but he tarried there not long; for the Cold ſoon made him to deſcend, that he could not get me ſo much as I deſir'd. But I feared he would tumble down, being half fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen; and beſides, he had not eaten his Breakfaſt, becauſe of their <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>

               <p>From thence we reaſſumed our way to return to <hi>Canibi,</hi> which is a Place <note place="margin">Canibi.</note> belonging to the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Patriarch, and had very bad Weather of Rain; ſo that we arrived there late in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, after having paſſed many little Habitations, ſituate for the moſt part upon the ſide of inacceſſible Rocks, and are almoſt all <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Chriſtians, with ſome few Moors amongſt them.

               <p>The next Day having heard Maſs, we returned to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> where I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a very troubleſome Winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> of the great Inundations of Water which came from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and ſo ſwelled a little River which runs through the middle of the City, that it bore down part of the Houſes, with great loſs of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and Water-mills, which it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

quite away, with the Stone-bridge. This was the cauſe that Bread was there very ſcarce and dear, that we had much adoe to get a little black Biſcuit, half ſpoiled, which was ſold me by weight, and at what rate they pleaſed, and that by halves; and the People already began to cry out for Famine. The Houſe of the Conſul of <hi>France</hi> fell upon him, and killed him: Several other Houſes fell alſo by this diſaſter of Inundation, which came in a Night without ſo much as dreaming of.</p>

The City is

The next Day we raiſed our little Caravan, which conſiſted of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and a <hi>Greek</hi> Chriſtian and his Siſter: This young <hi>Grecian</hi> Girl was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twelve Years of Age, and was very vertuous and brisk, being mounted
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61482:21"/>
upon her little Aſs, which was led by her Brother. We paſſed many Mountains, and arrived at a Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Arabians,</hi> where we had but very bad Lodging, lying along the Walls of the Houſes which are in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dirty Places: I made my Pillow of a Stone.</p>
               <p>The next Day we went to Dine at <hi>Armel,</hi> a little City of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Armel.</note> and then retired into a Houſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure very ſtately and magnificent, but there was none in it; it ſerves only for a retiring Place, and Lodging for the <hi>Caravans,</hi> they giving ſo much to the Porter who is the Keeper thereof: This Houſe is furniſh'd <note n="*" place="margin">After the Mooriſh manner.</note> 
                  <hi>a la Moreſque,</hi> and ſtrong enough to hold out an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault. A certain <hi>Turk</hi> who returned from the Baſſa of <hi>Tripoly</hi> cauſed it to be built after this manner: The Baſſa commanded him to be taken and brought into his preſence, telling him, That being his Subject he was greater than he, in regard of the ſumptuous and ſtrong Houſe which he had cauſed to be built, that he might rebel againſt him; and thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Head to be chopp'd off in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61482:22"/>
recompence of ſeveral good and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Services he had done him.</p>
               <p>Parting from this Place, we went along by a Rivolet to lodge upon a little Hill within the encloſure of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Walls very low, where there was a ſmall Cottage of the <hi>Arabians:</hi> We lay along the Wall, and paſſed the Night with great fear of the thieviſh <hi>Arabs.</hi> We parted from thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Morning, and came to <hi>Bailbec,</hi> a very ancient City, where <note place="margin">Bailbec.</note> formerly lived Chriſtians, the Ruines of a Church remaining there yet. I went into the City with my <hi>Mouquary,</hi> which was the <hi>Turk,</hi> that furniſhed me with a Horſe to ride upon, and there we ſought for a little Wine, but privately, it being forbid to ſell any: We found ſome White, very good, at the Houſe of a <hi>Grecian,</hi> who earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired us to hide it. They failed not to come to ſearch our Cloaths, and other things, but they could not find it, for we had locked it faſt up. We lay without the City along the Walls which are made of great Stones, not of Maſons Work, but roughly ſet one upon another, each one above
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61482:22"/>
12 or 15 Foot long. The Baſſa of this Place went out about Noon with all his Cavalry and Infantry, going to ſome Place, not far from thence, upon a Quarrel which he had againſt the Baſſa of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> He marched in excellent good order, eſpecially for <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> to obſerve.</p>
               <p>We diſlodged from this Place two or three Hours before Day, paſſing by Rocks, of which the moſt part were <note place="margin">Aquaeducts.</note> broke and thrown down, and the Veins and Pipes bigger than ones Arm are ſtill to be ſeen, through which flowed the Water before they were broke down: There is amongſt others one of theſe Rocks ſlit in two, about 3 or 4 Leagues from <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> and the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> which comes <note place="margin">Jordan.</note> from Mount <hi>Lebanus,</hi> paſſes with great ſwiftneſs very near it, there is a Bridge over which we paſſed: Along by this River are places cut like Caves within the Rock, where lived formerly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hermits; and truly the Place is very proper for a ſolitary Life, being exceeding deſert, and of difficult ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. We went to lie in a certain Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and the next Day we arrived
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61482:23"/>
at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> which was on <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Damaſcus.</note> Eve, the 14th. of <hi>April.</hi> I went to take a Lodging in the Houſe of one <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> a Rabbi of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom I had been recommended by a Couſin of his, which I had known at <hi>Tripoly.</hi> He received us after the beſt manner he could; but we ſupped but badly, becauſe it was the Day of their Sabbath, in which they dare ſcarce touch any thing. The next Day I ſo ordered the Buſineſs with this <hi>Jew,</hi> my Hoſt, that he gave me one of his Servants to conduct me, and help me to buy an Aſs. They were at that time making Preparations for their Paſſover, and I ſaw them buy Sheep in a Market for that purpoſe, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Paſſover of the</hi> Jews.</note> and this Servant choſe the fatteſt for his Maſter; ſo that I had much adoe to hale him to the place where I knew there was an Aſs to be ſold, which had been brought from <hi>Tripoly</hi> with us: I bargained for it for 19 Pataques <note place="margin">Pataques.</note> and a half one, for the <hi>Jew:</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed my Money, taking for <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Money, Pieces of Albouquelque, to give to the Cafars, and gained 55 for 50; for the Cafars go for as much <note place="margin">Cafars.</note>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:61482:23"/>
as thoſe of <hi>Spain.</hi> Albouquelques are pieces of <hi>German</hi> Money, having the <note place="margin">Albouquel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note> mark of a Lyon; the <hi>Turks</hi> take it for a Dog, and therefore call them Albou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelques or Dog-pieces. I deſired al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo my <hi>Jew</hi> to find me out a <hi>Turk,</hi> which he did, and promiſed him a Patache a Day, but he was to find himſelf with Victuals.</p>
               <p>As for this City of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> it is very fine and pleaſant, having moſt delicate Gardens, and is ſeated in a Valley, as it were in the middle of a Meadow; and there is a Lake and a River which paſs croſs it, with many excellent Fountains: Amongſt others is to be ſeen that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> near to a Moſque.</p>
               <p>This City is divided into two, by a great Church-yard of ſome 400 Paces, <note place="margin">Damaſcus <hi>deſcribed.</hi>
                  </note> after the Mooriſh manner: The whole City may be as big as <hi>Orleance.</hi> It is of great Trade; and amongſt others, there is a great Street, where there is nothing but Merchandice of Drugs and Spices. This City is encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Walls, but not round about, and has a very ſtrong Caſtle, and great number of Gardens in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61482:24"/>
Parts. There is a Baſſa, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and a multitude of <hi>Greek</hi> Chriſtians there, but no <hi>French.</hi> It is about Three Days Journey from the Sea, and Five from <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it was the greateſt Commerce of the <hi>Indies, Perſia, Chaldea, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and other Places.</p>
               <p>We left <hi>Damaſcus</hi> the 16th. of <hi>April,</hi> and went to <hi>Saſſa,</hi> where was a Cafar, <note place="margin">Cafars, or Toll.</note> or Toll: But my <hi>Turk,</hi> to ſave me from paying any thing, and thinking to have the half of that which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Cafar, put upon my Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, which was of the <hi>Greek</hi> Colour, another of white after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner, and paſſed thus without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken notice of by the Cafars, or elſe they were aſleep in their Houſes; for we ſaw none coming toward us as we paſſed over the Bridge which is there: So that we eſcaped, and went from thence through a very bad way full of great Stones, where I endured no ſmall pain, ſcarce being able to draw my ſelf out from amongſt them, becauſe of the Water and Mire which are together; and this bad way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued almoſt the whole Day. But as
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61482:24"/>
we were a good way in theſe Boggs and Quagmires, we ſaw coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cavalier, with a Harquebuſe at his Saddle-bow, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adventure of a</hi> Turk.</note> paſſing near to me, he demanded, <hi>An ta Frangi?</hi> if I was a Chriſtian; and having anſwered him, Yes, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Fury towards my <hi>Turk,</hi> who was before me, and held his Sword at his Throat to kill him, had not a poor <hi>Arabian,</hi> who was at work hard by, run to his ſuccour, praying this Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to be pacified; and from thence he came to give me a Blow with his Sword, but I gat my ſelf out of his way, and he ſpurring his Horſe upon me, cryed <hi>Rou,</hi> which is to ſay, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but my <hi>Turk</hi> ſo ordered the Matter, that he was content to take a Piece of Money, and the <hi>Arabian</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo mightily deſired him. After that, my <hi>Turk</hi> took away my white Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, ſhewing him that I had one of the right Colour underneath, and that this which he had given me was to keep me from the Sun.

I then threw away his white Cap, contenting my ſelf with my own, not having a mind ever to rely any more upon what he told me. We were in continual fear leſt theſe Cafars ſhould come after us, upon the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Cavalier, but they did not; yet my Turk was under ſuch a mortal Apprehenſion that they would, that he turned about ever and anon, and pricked on the Aſs as much as he could.

him with a curious great Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, which had been given me by one of the Baſſa's of <hi>Damaſcus</hi>'s Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. He was very well content therewith, and thought himſelf well payed for the Kindneſs he had done me with the Cafars.

               <p>From thence we paſſed through Deſerts, where was a great Number of Tents of the <hi>Arabs</hi> on each ſide, and began to mend our pace for the great Fear we were in, without reſting or refreſhing our ſelves at all; and I was very angry with my <hi>Turk,</hi> who would

not give me time to eat a bit of Bread, being very weak, having ſet out a little after Midnight, and made ſo much way; and beſides, our evil For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was not to find the leaſt drop of Water to drink. When we had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all theſe Habitations of <hi>Arabs,</hi> we went to pitch along by a Rock, where it was exceeding hot, and there ſeeking for Water we found ſome, though very little, which was Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water kept there a long time.

Our <hi>Turks,</hi> though they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dry, and are ruſtical and rough in their manner of living, could not drink the leaſt drop thereof.

them, without giving them ſome, tho' I had very great need of it my ſelf: But it behoved me ſo to do, if I had a mind to live quietly; my endeavour being to humour them as long as I was with them.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſed we this troubleſome Way as far as the Ciſtern of <hi>Joſeph,</hi>

for that purpoſe led me out of the way of the <hi>Chec,</hi> that he might the more eaſily rob me: When he was returned, I gave him Money, telling him that he might go his ways where he would, and that I would have no more to do with ſuch a wicked Man in my Company: But he told me that he was obliged to bring me ſafe to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and to bring News from me back to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> if I returned not with him: Finally, I was forced to bear with this Tyrant, who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver content with what I gave him, and beſides denied what I had given him at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> for Advance, and that which I gave him alſo at <hi>Gigny,</hi> thinking to have it over again.</p>
               <p>We departed thus from <hi>Gigny</hi> the 22d. of <hi>April,</hi> and came to <hi>Caranouby,</hi>

the Evening my <hi>Turk</hi> came to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, pretending ignorance of what had happened: But it behoved me to endure that alſo, and overlook it as my beſt way. The <hi>Chec</hi> continued two or three Days at <hi>Nabelous</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sick; for they preſent theſe ſick People to him, and he ſtretches out their Arms and Legs: then for his Pains he has Money given him, which his Secretary receives, giving little Tickets like Countercharms, and Notes for it.</p>
               <p>We had there great Rains, which we were forced to endure Day and and Night very patiently, without having any thing to ſhelter us<hi>:</hi> But ſeeing it continued without ceaſing, I placed my ſelf with theſe Three <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Brethren, not truſting my ſelf any longer with my <hi>Turk,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them into the City, with my little Baggage, not knowing then where this my gallant <hi>Mouquary</hi> was. We took up our Quarters in an old Vault full of Spiders: This Vault is <note place="margin">An Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Vault.</note> ſo ancient, that they ſay 'tis above Three Thouſand Years ſince it was made. In this Place lodge the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61482:33"/>
and the Caravans, which go and come. I tarried thus in this dark Hall amongſt the Mules and Aſſes, not having my ſelf ſo much as a Wiſp of Straw to lie upon, and being ſo crowded that I could not lie down, but was forced to remain cloſe by my Aſs, who was very impatient; for I cou'd get him nothing to eat.</p>
               <p>Having there paſſed this bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the next Day my <hi>Turk</hi> came to ſeek me out, pretending himſelf to be mighty buſie in looking for me; but he was a Drunkard, and minded nothing elſe but drinking of Shirbet, which was ſold in the Tents, from which he never ſtirred all the Day long, nor the very Night, and would fain have perſwaded me alſo to go there to drink of this Liquor, which they ſwallow down hot: It's of a very unſavoury Taſt, and blackiſh Colour; the <hi>Syrians</hi> call it <hi>Cody.</hi> In <hi>Tripoly</hi> are a great many Vaults like Taverns, where they moſt commonly go to drink this Shirbet, which is made of Seed and Water boiled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:61482:34"/>
Leaving this Place, we went to pitch our Tents two or three Leagues from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in a Place where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was a Chapel, which is half ruined, and there is a pleaſant Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hard by upon the way.</p>
               <p>The 27th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1612. we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived <note place="margin">

My <hi>Turk</hi> failed not to do what the other had commanded him, and made me tarry at the Gate of <hi>Jafe,</hi> where I was a long time waiting for the Trucher-Men, and an Officer of the Cadi, to viſit my Baggage. They being come, cauſed me to enter into the City, and led me where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious dwell, where they view'd my

               <p>After having viſited this Holy Place, on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning the 28th. of <hi>April,</hi> and heard Maſs, which was ſaid upon the Manger, and bought ſome Beads which the <hi>Greeks</hi> make there, I went to ſee the Grotto where the Virgin fled, when <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew the

Innocents. As I was coming out of this Place, I met ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Women, who came to deſire me to give ſome Remedy to their ſick Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe they had heard that I was a Haquin, or Surgion. I inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them, according to my ſmall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and as that Place would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Round about the City of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> are Vineyards: It is now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a lttle Village, full of old Ruines; and not far from thence is a Monaſtery, the Ruines of the City of <hi>Bethuly,</hi> where there is no Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">Bethuly.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Place of the Manger, it is at this Day nothing but an old ſtrong Vault, ſuſtained with little Pillars of Marble to keep it from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: The Vault is gilt with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Gold; they deſcend by ten or a dozen Steps: In the Place of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a great Marble-Stone.</p>
               <p>After that, I reaſſumed my way to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> where being come, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved me to ſell my Aſs to maintain me, as well at the entrance of the Holy Sepulchre, where I was to give 14 Sequins, which are about Twenty

Crowns; as alſo to give my <hi>Turk,</hi> who ſo inſulted over me, that I could ſcarce find Money enough to content him: He brought one of the Citiers, or Serjeants of the Cadi, to have me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maſter. When I had payed him by the Hands of my Trucher-Man, yet he almoſt deny'd that I had given him any thing, and would have done it, had not this Trucher-Man been with me to witneſs that I had payed him; and he was then conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: yet he alledged, that he had bought me an Aſs, not having Money enough to pay for him, as if it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to pay it, as if I had been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereto, and that I had not given him enough for the Courteſie, which he would ſhew to be as much as the Principal which I had agreed with him for a Month. In the end, ſeeing my ſelf ſo peſtered with this Man, who threatened to have me before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, or Judge of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to pluck a Ring from my Finger, and give it him in the preſence of the Trucher-Man.

               <p>The <hi>Saturday</hi> following, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, ſome Pilgrims that were there, and I, went to the Holy Sepulchre to do our Devotions; the Governour of the City having ſent the Keys upon Requeſt that was made to him, being there were lately Pilgrims arrived; and in entring the Church they cried to me <hi>Hada,</hi> which is to ſay, that I came the laſt; for the others had been there already to do their Devotions ſome Days before, and were minded to return there again upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Being there, we went all in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; and the Father <hi>Bucher,</hi> a Cordelier, made a Sermon, ſhewing us every Place where our Saviour had ſuffered any Pain; as the Place where is the Pillar to which he was tyed and ſcourged: Then we went to the Holy Grave, where he lay and was buried; this is like a little Cupolo, having within, a great Number of lighted Lamps, and an Altar where they ſay Maſs, which is upon the Sepulchre it ſelf<hi>:</hi> From thence we went to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and ſaw the Hole

where the Croſs was faſten'd, which is garniſhed on the inſide with Silver; the Rock hard by, is ſlit to the bottom; there are ſome Signs of a Chapel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

Having thus finiſhed my Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I returned back to the Monaſtery, and after Dinner taking one of the Religious, with one named <hi>Grand Fils,</hi> a <hi>Pariſian,</hi> who was alſo there: We went to the Street which is ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This <hi>Emir Joſeph,</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Ermine of Sydon,</hi> or <hi>Emir de Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ede,</hi> is very courteous and kind to the Chriſtians, and is ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from thoſe ancient Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were of the Blood of the Princes of <hi>France;</hi> and this is he who is ſaid to be ſince come into <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi> to the great Duke, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to become Chriſtian, and to propoſe Means to the Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces how to chaſe the <hi>Turks</hi> from thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Sydon,</hi> we went to lie at <hi>Baruth,</hi> which is a Place very pleaſant <note place="margin">Baruth</note> and delectable, having two little For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes upon the Sea-ſide. They ſay that this <hi>Baruth</hi> is the Place where

St. <hi>George</hi> ſlew the Dragon, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Maid, as the Pourtrayes ſhew which are made thereupon.</p>
               <p>The next Day, the 6th. of <hi>May,</hi> we arrived at <hi>Tripoly,</hi> where I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <note place="margin">Tripoly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> for ſome Days, employing my ſelf in gathering certain curious Plants, bearing excellent and odoriferous Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of which I gathered a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity upon Mount <hi>Lebanus,</hi> and about the City of <hi>Tripoly;</hi> all which I lay'd ſafe up to carry to the King, as at my Arrival at <hi>Paris</hi> they were planted in the Garden of the <hi>Lovre</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Majeſty's Chamber, whom I ſhewed ſeveral excellent Flowers.</p>
               <p>The Baſſa of <hi>Tripoly</hi> is a Man very Proud and Cruel; and I was told there, That once he being amorous of a very beautiful young Woman of one of the beſt Houſes in the City, and ſeeing that he could not bring his Deſires to paſs by any ſort of Artifice, he reſolved to uſe Violence; and watching his opportunity when ſhe went to the Stoves with her Mother, as it was their Cuſtom; where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently going, he took this poor young <note place="margin">Barbarous Cruelty of a Baſſa.</note> Woman by force, and having-had his
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61482:42"/>
Will of her, he took his Gangear, or Knife, made in the form of a Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and ript her open quite from the Privy-Parts up to the Neck. Behold how theſe Barbarians give Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their deſires, how horrible and wicked ſover they be!</p>
               <p>I was alſo told how that this Baſſa, at the Arrival of a certain <hi>French</hi> Ship, called the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> belonging to the Sieur <hi>de Moiſſet,</hi> had a mind to go on board her, where having been treated with all the Complaiſance ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, at his coming out from thence one of his Favourites reproached him for eating with the Chriſtians; at which he was in ſuch a Fury, that he caſt his Gangear at him, with which he ſo wounded him, that had not the Surgeon immediately dreſſed him, he had died thereof upon the Place. They relate ſeveral other cruel Acts and Violences of this Man, which are very ordinary and common to all theſe Race of Infidels.</p>

But after having ſo well begun what I had at that time in hand, I judged that to purſue it according to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, it would be neceſſary for me to undertake ſome more Voyages, and I had no leſs deſign than to encompaſs the whole World, firſt by way of the Occident, and from thence by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient to return again into our Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; an Enterprize, I muſt confeſs, ſo great, that the only Preſumption of ſo much as ever having it in my Mind, I believe would have gained me Glory enough; and yet I hoped, that by the Grace of him who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conducted me every where, I ſhould have been able to have brought it to paſs. But I was defeated of theſe my Purpoſes by the Occaſions following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:61482:44"/>
With this Intention then I left <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and followed Their Majeſties to <hi>Tours,</hi> in the Voyage which they made there in the Year 1614. in <hi>July.</hi> From thence I embarked upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Loir,</hi> to go to <hi>Nantes,</hi> and to St. <hi>Leiger,</hi> to wait for occaſion and conveniency to paſs to <hi>Portugal,</hi> from whence I was to purſue my Deſigns. But having put out to Sea, the Wind turned ſo contrary, that we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to draw back to St. <hi>Leiger,</hi> tho' not without a deal of Trouble; and there hearing that the King was at <hi>Nants,</hi> I took the Occaſion to go there to furniſh my ſelf with ſome Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which I had forgotten, and which I judged needful for my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>This being done, I returned to St. <hi>Leger,</hi> but I found that the Veſſel in my abſence had ſet ſail, having a right Wind; and which was worſe, had alſo carried away all my Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which I provided for the Paſſage, with ſome other things, which I never could hear of ſince.

               <p>Parting then from <hi>San Lucar,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>Mareme,</hi> along by the great River <hi>Guadalquivir,</hi> I came to <hi>Seville,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Seville.</note> and immediately placed my ſelf in the Shop of the moſt famous Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary of the whole City, in the Street called <hi>di los Francos:</hi> The Maſter was named <hi>Alonſo Rodrigo,</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> with whom I continued for ſome time, both to learn the Language, of which
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61482:46"/>
I had already ſome Knowledge, and to have alſo ſome Knowledge of Drugs, of which this Man made the greateſt Traffick: For he had Two or Three great Magazines in his Houſe, and as much or more in other Places of the City, where his Children put off the Drugs.</p>
               <p>After having tarried ſome time with him, I left him, for the great Deſire I had to find an Occaſion to embark; but I was ſtill detained by another, named <hi>Juan Sancha,</hi> who had alſo dwelt with this <hi>Rodrigo,</hi> and was Apothecary to the Army, and the Frontier Cities in <hi>Africa,</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> He was to have a Shop at <hi>Marmorre,</hi> a Place which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had newly taken in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured mightily to perfect this Shop which he was to ſend to this Fortreſs. I tarried then to help him, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there from the 3d. of <hi>November</hi> to the 8th. of <hi>January,</hi> until his Shop was finiſhed. From thence I went to walk in the Fields to take the freſh Air, becauſe of the great Filth of this City of <hi>Seville,</hi> which cauſes there
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61482:46"/>
a very bad Air, which is purſued by a great Number of Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>As I was traverſing on Foot ſome Mountains, to obſerve the Nature of Trees, I met with an honeſt Cavalier, named <hi>Pedro Sancha,</hi> as I knew ſince, who courteouſly invited me to come and lodge at his Houſe in a little City called <hi>Corea,</hi> or <hi>Coria,</hi> not far from thence, which I could not well refuſe. He entertained me very kindly, and I ſtayed there till the next Day; then I reaſſumed my way to the Mountains, where I was for ſome Days taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Plants, and found ſtore of Roſemary, and a great quantity of Maſtick-Trees, with which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is mighty abounding; amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I gathered ſome Thiſtles called <hi>Chameleonis-Ally,</hi> ſome Flowers of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus, and ſome Mandrake-Apples, which they call <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bollas de Villana:</hi> After that, when I ſaw that I had but bad Entertainment in theſe Deſarts, where moſt commonly I found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Water, and ſome Raiſins to eat, and ſometimes a little Bread, in the Shepherd's Cabins, I returned towards <hi>Corea,</hi> and viſited my honeſt
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61482:47"/>
Hoſt, the Sieur <hi>Pedro Sanche,</hi> who was very glad to ſee me, and made very much of me. He afterwards came to ſee me at <hi>Seville,</hi> to have the Interpretation of ſome Receipts which had been given him for his Wife who was with Child.</p>
               <p>From thence I returned to <hi>Seville,</hi> where the Sieur <hi>Juan Sanche,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary, would have perſwaded me to tarry with him; but I had my Voyage of the <hi>Indies</hi> ſo in my Head, that I had no mind to tarry there, but took my way ſtreight to St. <hi>Luear,</hi> and ſailed along the River, with a great many other Perſons for Company in a Boat.</p>
               <p>We arrived in the Night-time at St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> and I went to lodge with my former Hoſt, who was called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanuil Biſcain.</hi> I continued there for ſome Days to wait for an Occaſion to embark: But my bad Fortune would have it ſo, that the Veſſels which were then in the Port, durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out, becauſe they had Advice, that from <hi>Argier,</hi> and other Places of <hi>Barbary,</hi> were put out to Sea near Fifty Veſſels, who guarded the Coaſts,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61482:47"/>
and were ſeparated 10, 15, and 20 Ships, towards each Height and Cape, where they thought they were to paſs; ſo that they took all they could meet with.</p>
               <p>Seeing my ſelf thus retained, and without much Commodities to live by, having already ſpent the moſt part of what I had, I was conſtrained, in expectation of better Conveniency, to place my ſelf with an Apothecary of St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> who made me promiſe to ſerve him for ſome time. But as Fortune never left Perſecuting of me, ſo this poor Man returning one Night from Supper in the City, was arreſted Priſoner by the Command of the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia;</hi> and after that, the Juſtice came to his Houſe and ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all his Papers, where the Alg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aziles, or Sergeants made a ſtrange Ravage. They accuſed him for having made ſome Libel againſt the Duke. I ſpent this Night with no ſmall Trouble and Uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>The next Day I went again into the Fields to go towards the Port <hi>St. Mary,</hi> where I made ſo much haſt, after having paſſed many Places by
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61482:48"/>
Water, and bad way, that I arrived there at Night in Company of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Jacobin,</hi> who ſhewed me a great deal of Courteſie, and cauſed me to lodge with him in the Houſe of a Muleteer. The Day following, I took the way of <hi>Xerez de la Frontera,</hi> and had no ſmall Trouble before I could come there, for the great Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Waters which I found by the way. At laſt, having eſcaped them as well as I could, and being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak in regard of the great Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I endured, by good Fortune I met with two Men in ſight of <hi>Xerez,</hi> who courteouſly invited me to eat with them; and being ſate down to eat, they fell to diſcourſing of ſeveral Things, and amongſt others, came upon my Subject, ſpeaking of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that it is the moſt eaſie to be ſupported, when one ſtirs not from a Place without doing any thing, or when one is at Work, and thinks of doing ſome other thing: At laſt one of them concluded, that he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of more Hunger when he was doing nothing, than when he was at work, and found that there was ſome
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61482:48"/>
reaſon for it, in regard that Action diverts the Thoughts: And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that I heard reported, how that the ſeveral ſorts of Plays, as Cards, Dice, Tables, and others, were at firſt invented to amuſe Men during a great Scarcity of Victuals, and by this means to divert them from thinking upon their Hunger. And therefore 'tis ſaid, That <hi>Drake,</hi> that ſamous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain, returning home from his great Voyage about the World, (which he had encompaſſed,) one Day, as he found himſelf in great neceſſity of Victuals, and ſaw his Men ready to ſtarve with Hunger, he cauſed them to play to divert themſelves; and when they were thirſty, he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to ſleep to refreſh themſelves. This Scarcity was ſo great, as I have heard ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſay, That they were forced to eat ſome Blacks which they had brought along with them, and having found near <hi>England</hi> a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel loaded with Victuals, they eat ſo much thereof, that the moſt part of them died by over charging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:61482:49"/>
But to return to <hi>Xerez:</hi> Being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">Xerez.</note> there, tho' not without abundance of trouble, paſſing through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I by chance found my ſelf near the Shop of an Apothecary, where there was ſome Surgions diſcourſing together. When they ſaw me, they caſt out ſome Words of Mocking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my Garb, <hi>à la Francois:</hi> But I returning towards them, told them a few Words of Chirurgery in <hi>Latin;</hi> which they being ignorant of they knew not what to anſwer, except by naming to me, to ſurprize me, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Compoſition called <hi>Hieralogod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There I found a <hi>Perſian</hi> Slave, who hearing me ſpeak of his Country, and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> was ſo overjoy'd, that he called me his Kinſman, and made
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61482:49"/>
me as good Chear as he could in this Houſe, where he had much Credit.</p>
               <p>This City of <hi>Zerez</hi> is ſituated on high in a very pleaſant Country, as all the reſt of the Province of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſia,</hi> and is not far from the little River <hi>Ovadal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When I was there, I was told how that the Judge of that Place, whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had eſtabliſhed there, not having a mind to do a piece of Injuſtice, as the Gentlemen and Hidalgo's of the City deſired him, they had invited him to a Supper, with an Intention to put an Affront upon him; but he doubting of their Ill-will, would not go to them: At which they being vexed, made his Image, and burnt it in a Fire before his own Door in a Bravado; and in the mean

time, he not daring to ſtir out of his Houſe, which was as it were beſieged by them. Upon which, his Wife went ſtrait to Court, to make her Complaint to the King, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Juſtice of him, which was granted her: For the King of <hi>Spain</hi> commanded theſe inſolent Hidalgo's, or Gentlemen, to come before him, and ordered their Proceſs to be drawn immediately, and condemned them every one to have their Heads chopp'd off. But when they ſaid for Excuſe, that they were drunk when they put this Affront upon the Judge, they were pardon'd, and had his Grace, except Two Brothers, who never would confeſs themſelves to be drunk when they play'd this Prank, and were ſo glorious, that they choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have their Heads cut off, than to confeſs the ſame, as the reſt had done. And hereupon came the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, That <hi>Los Hidalgos di Xerez Son Borrachos,</hi> The Gentlemen of <hi>Xerez</hi> are Drunkards.</p>

After having tarried ſome Days at <hi>Xerez,</hi> I returned to the Port St. <hi>Mary,</hi> expecting to find an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for my Embarkment: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, I could not by my utmoſt Endeavour, procure Licenſe to paſs to the <hi>Indies,</hi> in regard of the rigorous Injunction not to ſuffer any Strangers to go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>French;</hi> yet if I had had Money to give, perhaps I might have had this Permiſſion; but I had not ſo much as a Maravedis, nor Hopes to meet with any there, beſides that I found my ſelf ſomewhat indiſpos'd. All this, with the bad Entertainment which I receiv'd amongſt theſe People ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and Diſcourteous, gave me cauſe to deſire my Return, and thought to embark my ſelf in ſome <hi>Aulonno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> Ships, to return with them to <hi>France;</hi> and indeed I gathered together ſome rare Plants, which I put into a Veſſel, with ſome other things, of which I never ſince could hear any notice, but that they had caſt all into the Sea. In the mean time I wondred why this Ship did not ſet ſail, but ſhe was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

by the Decreaſe of the Moon; for the Sea does ſo follow the courſe of this changing Planet, that it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice, that the Ebbing and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in the heighth, when the Moon is in Conjunction.</p>
               <p>This Ship of <hi>Aulonne</hi> which I wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, was called the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> and belonged to one <hi>Peter Bled:</hi> In the mean time the Veſſel departed without taking me in, and I remain'd there in no ſmall trouble and miſery; and had no other Recourſe, but to put my ſelf into a Boat which I found go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Calix,</hi> not far from thence; and nevertheleſs we had no ſmall Trouble in our Paſſage, becauſe of the contrary Winds. We at laſt went on ſhoar in a deſart Place, about a League from <hi>Calix,</hi> to which Place I went on foot along by the ſhore: I there found Acquaintance, but I could not ſtay there long, becauſe the City was filled with Soldiers belonging to the Army of <hi>Dom Lous de Fajardo,</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, who was juſt returned from <hi>Mamorre,</hi> which he had taken from the <hi>Moors,</hi> and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61482:51"/>
had there found a great Number of Pyrates, of whom ſome he had hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put the reſt to the Oar; the reſt were partly ſunk, and ſome burnt themſelves in deſpair, rather than thoy would yield.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Gades</hi> in ancient times was not very Populous, and is at this Day a little City, celebrated for the Salt-pits, and Almadraves, or the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing for the Tonny. This was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly an Iſle diſtant above 700 Paces from the main Land; but at preſent there is only a little Cauſey which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates it therefrom.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that I could not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently tarry at <hi>Calix,</hi> I went into the Fields towards an old ruined Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which they call the <hi>Tower of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> not far diſtant from the <hi>Straights.</hi> I found there ſome rare Plants, which I loaded my ſelf withal, and ſaw this Tower, into which I entred, though not without a great deal of trouble, becauſe the Sea beats againſt it; and beſides, there came ſuch a furious Wave, that I thought it would have
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:61482:52"/>
carried me away. This Building is ſo well wrought, and appears ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, that it ſeems not to have been 20 Years ſince it was built. Now, as I was amongſt theſe Ruines, I ſaw a great Wolf approach towards me, which I thought at firſt to be an Aſs; but after having known what it was, I kept my ſelf ſtill, and let it paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by me, without ſtirring a Foot, for I ſaw that it was looking for Food. Not far from theſe Ruines I found a Temple, where I enter'd, and it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like an Azoy, or Moſque, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner; yet there is an Altar ſet up, where ſometimes they ſay Maſs.</p>
               <p>As I was returning towards <hi>Calix,</hi> I found the Sea mightily riſen, ſo that I was a little wet in repaſſing the ſame; and had I ſtayed but a little longer, I had had a bad Nights Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there: At laſt I paſſed over, and found in my way a good old Man, who diſcourſed a great while with me about all theſe Antiquities; and how that in thoſe Days there was more Men morally Good than now, though they

and from thence I came to a Place na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Chipione,</hi> where having gotten ſome Money by certain Cures, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to San <hi>Lucar,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Sevillia,</hi> where I was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ſome time and joined my ſelf with a certain Apothecary, who lived in the <hi>Triane,</hi> or on the other ſide of the Bridge.

               <p>Whilſt I was there, I remember that they of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Ann,</hi> or the Suburb of <hi>Triane,</hi> made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion on <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

carrying all lighted Wax-Candles, and ſung a Hymn in Honour of the Bleſſed Virgin, to ſhew that ſhe was conceived without Original Sin; to which they applied the Words of the Royal Pſalmiſt, <hi>Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei; &amp; in ſole poſuit tabernaculum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> &amp;c. and other ſuch-like things. And hereupon the whole City of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> was in an Uproar, and there were ſome Prieſts themſelves put into the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> becauſe they had the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to maintain, that the Virgin was conceiv'd in Sin; inſomuch that there was likely to be a great Tumult; and my <hi>Jew</hi> was then in ſuch fear, that he durſt ſcarcely ſtir out of his Houſe, though he was of this ſame Pariſh. There was ſome, who either out of Fear, or Devotion, wore, writ upon their Hatbands in great Letters, theſe Words, <hi>Sin pecado Original voto a tal:</hi> to ſhew that they believed, or would have others believe.

Leaving then my Apothecary, ſtill ſick as I was, having found ſome Friends who lent me Money, I returned towards <hi>San Lucar,</hi> in Hopes to find Means to embark my ſelf, not for the <hi>Indies,</hi> (of which I had loſt all Hopes,) but to return into <hi>France:</hi> But as my bad Fortune would have it, not far from <hi>San Lucar</hi> I was Robbed in the Pinars; and coming to <hi>San Lucar,</hi> I ſoon found out who it was that had robbed me, but I du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now one Day, when it was a great Calm, this Captain invited on board his Ship the Admiral, and Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, with other Captains, who had treated him before: And after having made good Cheer together, and drunk
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61482:54"/>
plentifully of theſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines, they withdrew themſelves each one on board his own Ship. In the mean time the Wind began to riſe, and we were forced to change the Sails; but all the Mariners, and the Pilot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were ſo drunk, that they knew not what they did: When he who was at the Helm commanded to ſet to the Larboard, they hal'd to the Starboard, having the Wind in their Faces; one cried this way, another that way, it being the greateſt Confuſion in the World, not one underſtanding what another ſaid. When I ſaw that, I took the Helm my ſelf, and brought the Ship fairly before the Wind; then came a <hi>French</hi> Mariner, who was juſt come out of Captivity from <hi>Barbary,</hi> and had not drank ſo much as the reſt. I quitted the Bar to him, becauſe I was bid to beware of the Captain, who was in a great Rage againſt me<hi>:</hi> Nevertheleſs that hindred me not from going to find him out upon the Deck, where he was ſtill emptying ſome Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Wine with his Mariners. As ſoon as he ſaw me, he began to mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſomething to himſelf; whereupon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61482:55"/>
I took up a Cup and drank to him, which pacified him a little, and told me that he was very angry with me; and having asked him the Cauſe, he ſhewed me his Arm, ſcarce being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak, meaning to tell me that I had never a Lancet to let Blood. Hereupon I doubted that a wicked <hi>Norman</hi> had told him of that; for in parting from <hi>San Lucar</hi> I had told him how I had been Robb'd, yet I had made Proviſion of Medicines to cure the Sick when there ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and I had cured the Captain's own Brother of a certain Pain that he had in his Legs, which was no ſmall Help to me; for ever ſince that time he was always my Friend againſt thoſe who had a mind to do me any wrong, and eſpecially this <hi>Norman,</hi> who made it his chief Buſineſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate theſe People againſt me, to the end that they might do me Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; but God preſerved me from them. The next Day they took a poor Boy, a <hi>Fleming,</hi> who was a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and tied him faſt to the great Sail-yard, to duck him into the Sea, becauſe, as they ſaid, he had been
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61482:55"/>
drunk, and had ſpoiled the Deck<hi>:</hi> He was thus hoiſed up Three times by the Sail-yard, and ſo duck'd in the Sea, after the Captain had firſt drank to him, which he pledged. 'Twas a great Pity to hear the Cries and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of this poor Boy, and I was not able to behold a Spectacle ſo cruel, but withdrew my ſelf below Deck, where in the mean time I heard them murmuring againſt me, at the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this <hi>Norman,</hi> who had been Captain of a Ship in the New-found Lands, and was now a Paſſenger in this Veſſel, having more ſtore of Crowns than Good-nature.</p>
               <p>After having ſailed thus for ſome time, we arrived happily, by the Grace of God, at the <hi>Havre,</hi> the 15th. Day <note place="margin">

But God be praiſed for all, to whom I render infinite Thanks that it hath pleaſed his Divine Goodneſs to preſerve me from my Infancy to this time, from ſo many ſeveral Misfortunes
